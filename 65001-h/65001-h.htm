<p>Bow!</p>

<p>I always begin a story that way. It is
what you Two-Legged Folks call “making
your bow.” With us dogs it means “Hello”
and “How do you do” and “Good morning”
and—and lots of other things too. And
sometimes it means “Look out!” You see, we
have so many ways of saying it!</p>

<p>Perhaps some day I’ll tell you how to know
just what we mean when we say “Bow!”—like
that—sort of quick and friendly; and
what we mean when we say it slow and gruff,
way down in our throats.</p>

<p>And then there’s “Wow!” too. “Wow” is
different from “Bow.” And “Bow-wow” is
still different. But this isn’t telling my story,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Of course, you haven’t said you wanted me
to tell you my story, but I’m almost sure you
do. I think you’ll like it, because I am a very
good story-teller—for a dog. And, although
I am not quite three years old, I have seen a
lot of things in my day.</p>

<p>You won’t mind if I wag my tail now and
then, will you? It is very hard for a dog to
tell a tale without wagging. Some folks say
a dog talks with his tail. He doesn’t though;
not really. He just uses his tail the way you
Two-Legged Folks use your hands, to make
others understand better what you are saying.</p>

<p>When you tell a story you should always
start right at the very beginning, and that is
what I am going to do.</p>

<p>The first thing I remember was when I was
about two weeks old. I’m sure you can’t remember
when you were two weeks old. I
think that is very clever of me, don’t you? It
shows what a fine memory I have. I was lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
in a sort of cage made of criss-cross wires.
There was sawdust on the floor. There were
four of us in all, for I had two sisters and one
brother. My mother’s name was Gretchen
and my father’s name was Fritz. I am
named after my father. He had two or three
other names besides, but they’re very hard to
say, being German. You see my father and
mother were both born in Germany and
brought to this country when they were very
young, and so, of course, they spoke German
very nicely. But they never taught it to me.
I suppose there wasn’t time. There are so
many, many things a puppy has to learn. I
didn’t see much of my father when I was a
tiny puppy. Sometimes he came to the cage
where we lived and licked our noses through
the wires, but he was a very busy dog and
had lots of things to attend to.</p>

<p>My mother was very beautiful, with the
loveliest soft brown eyes and the longest, silkiest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
ears and quite the crookedest front legs you
ever saw. (You see, in my family crooked
front legs are much admired.) We all loved
her very dearly, but I am afraid we caused her
a lot of trouble. But she was very fond of us
and very proud of us. Sometimes I wished
she wasn’t so careful about keeping us clean,
for lots of times when I wanted to play with
my brother and sisters I couldn’t because she
had to wash me all over. You see, puppies
don’t like being washed much more than you
do; and I heard you making an awful fuss this
morning!</p>

<p>We lived very happily in the cage for several
weeks. We ate and slept and played, but
most of all we ate and slept. At first it must
have been funny to see us trying to walk, for
our legs were so weak that they just sprawled
out under us when we wanted to use them.
But it wasn’t long before we could run and
jump as much as we pleased. I was the biggest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and the strongest of us all, and I think
my mother was every bit as fond of me as
she was of my two sisters and my brother, but
it <em>did</em> seem to me as if I got most of the punishment.
Maybe I was the naughtiest one, too!</p>

<p>As we grew older and stronger our mother
used to leave us alone for a little while every
day, and we didn’t like that at all at first. We
used to whine and cry and feel very lonesome
until she came back. But she always <em>did</em> come
back, and pretty soon we got to know that she
would, and so we didn’t mind so much. We
had some lovely frolics, we puppies. We used
to make believe that we were very cross, and
tumble each other over in the sawdust and bite
each other’s ears and legs and growl such funny
little growls!</p>

<p>A man named William looked after us. He
wore leather gaiters. They tasted very well.
Mother said he was a coachman. He was very
kind to us and brought us things to eat and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
water to drink and petted us a lot. Then there
was another man who only came to see us a few
times. We didn’t like him so well. He was
a Doctor and smelled of medicine. He came
to see us once when my sister Freya was sick
and once when I had an awful pain in my insides.
That was later, though, after we were
out of the cage and running around in the
yard. It was when I ate the harness soap.
Mother told me afterwards that it was a mistake
to eat any kind of soap. I think she was
right.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there was the Master, and
the Mistress, and, best of all, the Baby. She
wasn’t exactly a baby, because she was almost
two years old, but every one called her the
Baby. We all loved her very much. She
used to take us up one by one and kiss us on
our noses and call us “Booful dogums” and
hug us. Sometimes she hugged so hard it
hurt, but we never let her know it. She had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
golden hair and blue eyes and two little fat
red cheeks and was always laughing. Her real
name was Mildred. The Master was a very
big man, so big that I could only see to the
tops of his riding-boots when I was little. He
had a very deep, gruff voice and called us
“Those little rascals!” But we knew he didn’t
mean it and we liked him. But we liked the
Baby best of all, and after her the Mistress,
who was the Baby’s mother. She was quite
small for a grown-up and had such a nice voice
that we loved to hear it and would all go running
to the front of the cage or the yard fence
when she came.</p>

<p>The Family—we called the Master, the Mistress
and the Baby the Family—lived in the
country in a beautiful white house with green
blinds that stood on top of a little hill and had
trees and fields all around it. There was a
pond, too, and a brook that ran out of it.
That’s where the ducks lived. Ducks are very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
funny things. Later I’ll tell you something
about them. There was a stable, as well, and
outside the stable was a yard fenced in with
wire netting, and in the corner of the yard
was what they called the Kennel. That was
where I was born. The yard was quite large
and after we were allowed to run around in it,
we had a fine time. There was so much to see
from it: the house and the duck-pond and the
country road, with people going by that had
to be barked at, and the place where William
washed the carriages when the weather was
fine, and many other things. Also, there were
squirrels in the trees, and birds, too. And
there was Ju-Ju.</p>

<small>WHAT WE LEARNED</small></h3>
</div>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_11">She used to think they were to chase</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Ju-ju was a cat. She was grey, like smoke,
and had a bushy tail and long hair and yellow
eyes. I don’t think yellow eyes are very
pretty, do you? None of us ever liked Ju-ju
very much, although we soon got to respect
her. She was very vain of her long hair and
thick tail and used to spend hours doing nothing
but washing herself. Cats are very lazy,
I think, and waste too much time on themselves.
Once I asked Mother what cats were
for and she sighed and said <a href="#i_012">she used to think
they were to chase</a> but she had changed her
mind <a href="#i_013">and thought now they were just to look
at</a>. Mother had a place on her nose like a
scratch where the hair never grew and sometimes
I’ve wondered whether Ju-ju made it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
When we first got
out into the yard
Ju-ju used to come
and jump on top of
one of the fence-posts
and look down
at us just as though
we were funny and
strange. That used
to make us very
angry and we would
bark and jump at
the post for the
longest time. But
of course we
couldn’t reach her
and after awhile she
would blink and
blink at us and then
go to sleep up there!
Cats are very annoying.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
They’re almost as bad as ducks!</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_013">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_11">... and thought now they were just to look at</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We were born in the Spring and lived in the
yard until we were four months old. Then
my brother, whose name was Franz, and one
of my sisters, whose name was Franzchen, left
us. They went away off to live in the city
and Freya and I were quite lonely at first, and
our mother felt very badly about it. But she
told us that they had gone to live with some
nice, kind people and would be very happy, and
after that we didn’t feel so badly about it.</p>

<p>After Franz and Franzchen left us we were
no longer kept in the
Kennel yard, but were
allowed to go anywhere
we pleased—except the
house. We weren’t allowed
in the house, but
sometimes we got in.
When we did we
scampered straight for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the kitchen. The first time we did it Cook had
a tin dish filled with cake-batter in her hand
and when we ran at her and barked and
jumped up on her she was so surprised and
scared that she cried “Saints presarve us!” and
dropped the dish. <a href="#i_014fp">Most of the batter went on
Freya</a> and she ran out as quick as she could go,
much more frightened than Cook, and I after
her. We had a fine time licking the batter off.
It was nice and sweet and sticky and lasted
all day. Father was quite angry with us, but
Mother said “Puppies will be puppies.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_014fp">
  <img src="images/i_014fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_14">Most of the batter went on Freya</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After that it was very hard to get in the
kitchen, and when we did get in Cook would
drive us out with a broom. Of course we tried
not to go and made believe we didn’t know
what she meant when she cried “Shoo!” and
“Scat!” We would run under the tables and
into the pantry and quite often she would have
to coax us out with pieces of meat or something
nice. It was very exciting. If we thought
she really meant to hit us with the broom we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
would lie on our backs with our feet in the
air and pretend we were awfully frightened.
Then Delia, who was the maid and a great
friend of ours, would say “Oh, the poor little
dears. Don’t you dare hit them, Mary McGuire!”
Then we would have a piece of cake
each and Delia would pet us and put us outside.</p>

<p>Father was a very busy dog and had a great
many things to look after. He always went
to drive with our Mistress and sat very straight
and fine beside William on the front seat.
Then, too, <a href="#i_020fp">he had to help William do all sorts
of things</a>, like wash the carriages and feed the
chickens and ducks and cut the grass and rake
the leaves. He must have been a great comfort
to William.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_020fp">
  <img src="images/i_020fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_15">He had to help William do all sorts of things</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mother had her paws full looking after us
most of that summer and so she was not able
to help much with the work. Of course she
kept watch and taught us to, and we soon
learned who to bark at and who not. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the man from the butcher’s came Mother always
made it a point to be very polite to him.
She wagged her tail and sniffed his boots and
followed him around to the kitchen door. He
smelled very nice. Sometimes he gave us
small pieces of meat and we were always glad
to see him. But when a tramp or a pedlar
came Mother barked and the hair stood up all
along her back. We soon learned to do the
same and tramps didn’t very often come much
farther than the gate.</p>

<p>Of course <a href="#i_030fp">we learned</a> a great many other
things too. Such as <a href="#i_030fp">to stand on our hind legs
and beg</a> when we wanted anything and not get
under the feet of the horses and keep away
from the carriage wheels. Once a wheel went
over the end of my tail and it hurt a good deal
and I crawled into a stall and cried. Mother
came and told me I was too old to cry and
that it would teach me to keep out of the way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_030fp">
  <img src="images/i_030fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_16">We learned to stand on our hind legs and beg</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another thing we learned was not to jump
up on the Baby. We did it because we loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
her and wanted to lick her face, but she always
tumbled over. That was because she only had
two legs and was no fault of ours. Once when
she tumbled she struck her head against something
hard and cried dreadfully. We licked
her face as hard as we could to comfort her,
because that is what Mother always did to us
when we were hurt, but it didn’t seem to do
her much good. Then William came running
up and cuffed us pretty hard and picked Baby
up. I don’t think he should have punished us,
but maybe he didn’t understand. After that
we didn’t do it any more.</p>

<p>Another thing we soon learned was to let
Ju-ju alone. One day, soon after we were allowed
to go where we liked, Freya and I came
across Ju-ju in the kitchen yard. She was
fast asleep and we thought it would be great
fun to jump at her and bark. So we did it
and she woke up awfully quick and scratched
me on the nose and chased Freya half-way to
the stable. Cats can’t take a joke.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_1III">CHAPTER III<br />
<small>PUPPY TROUBLES</small></h3>
</div>


<p>We learned a good deal about what was good
to eat and what wasn’t, too. Once Delia left
a tin pan filled with some whitish stuff on the
back steps and I ate quite a lot of it before
she came out and found what I was doing.
When she did she cried “Cook! Cook! One of
the Puppies has eaten the starch!” Of course
I went right away, as I didn’t want to have
any trouble about it, and pretty soon I felt
very funny inside and crawled into a stall
where it was quiet and dark. But William
found me after a while and made me swallow
something that didn’t taste at all nice and
pretty soon I felt better. I didn’t think it was
very kind of Delia to tell William what I had
done, but maybe it was all for the best, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
until he made me swallow the nasty medicine
I was pretty sure I was going to die. Starch
and soap taste all right but they aren’t good
for puppies. I found that out.</p>

<p>It seems that we all have to learn a lot of
things by what Mother calls “sad experience.”
Like bees. Bees look very much like flies but
they’re different. Once Freya and I saw some
bees going in and out of a tiny hole in the
ground back of the stable. They were very
large bees and growled. We wondered why
they went into the hole and so we scratched at
it to find out. While we were doing it quite
a lot of bees came out and Freya gave a yelp
and began to paw at her nose. She looked so
funny that I laughed at her and asked why she
did it. Then I gave a yelp and forgot all
about Freya. Those bees were very angry
and sat down on us wherever our hair was thin,
and every time they sat down they scratched.
We didn’t stay there long, I can tell you! We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
ran as fast as we could run, but the bees flew
right along with us and chased us way down
to the duck-pond. By that time I had five
scratches and Freya had four and they hurt a
good deal and swelled up. We licked the
scratches and whined and after a while we
rolled over in the mud at the edge of the pond
and that made them feel better. But they
didn’t stop hurting for a long time. After
that if a bee came <em>buzz-buzzing</em> around us we
always made believe we didn’t see it. But we
got up very quietly and moved away.</p>

<p>Then there are balls. Some balls are nice
to play with and chew on. They are made of
rubber. William had one and he used to
throw it, and Freya and I, and sometimes
Mother and Father, too, would scamper after
it and see who could get it and bring it back
to him. If Freya got it I always took it away
from her, because I am bigger and stronger
than she is. Besides, she’s only a girl dog!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Once Freya found the ball in the harness room,
where it had dropped off a shelf, and so she
took it out under a tree and chewed on it until
there was a hole in it. Then she wanted to see
what was in the hole and so she tore the ball
all to pieces. There wasn’t a thing in it. She
ate some of the pieces and that afternoon the
Doctor came and stayed quite a long time and
Freya was very sick. William got another
ball, but Freya would never go near it.</p>

<p>At the side of the house toward the orchard
there was a lawn where the Family played a
game they called croquet. They had mallets
and a lot of different coloured wooden balls and
they made the balls roll by hitting them with
the mallets. Once Freya and I were there and
we chased the balls. The Master laughed at
us and said we mustn’t do it. But he didn’t
really care, and the Baby, who was there with
Nurse, clapped her hands and thought it was
fine fun. So did we. We would run at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
balls and bark at them and try to pick them up
in our mouths. But we couldn’t because they
were too big. The Master and Mistress
laughed and laughed at us. Then I saw a ball
rolling along very fast and I made believe it
was a rat and ran for it as hard as I could go.
But when I tried to bite it it wouldn’t stop but
kept right on rolling. And so I rolled too.
I rolled several times and when I found my
feet I hurried off with a terrible pain in my
head. Rubber balls and wooden balls are very
different, like flies and bees.</p>

<p>About that time we had our first collars.
Mine was black and Freya’s was brown. William
said that was so people could tell us apart.
I thought it was very silly of him because we
didn’t look at all alike. I was bigger and, if
I do say it myself, much finer looking. But
that is what he said. The collars had little
round brass tags on them and on the tags were
numbers. They were quite like the collars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that Father and Mother wore, only a great
deal smaller, and we were very proud of them.
William put a strap from Freya’s collar to
mine and then snapped a leash on to the strap
and said “Come on.” I trotted right along,
but Freya sat down and wouldn’t budge an
inch. So, of course, I had to pull her all the
way to the house. It was very hard work for
me, and Freya didn’t like it much, either. She
howled all the way up the drive and William
just laughed at her. I was quite ashamed of
her for acting so. The Master and Mistress
and the Baby came out to see us and I tried to
put a good face on it by laughing too, but
Freya just howled and howled! Girl dogs are
very silly sometimes! Then the Master said:</p>

<p>“Take the leash off, William, and see what
they’ll do.”</p>

<p>So he did and I ran up to the Mistress and
Freya tried to run toward the stable. I wasn’t
going to have that, so I dragged Freya after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
me and the Baby was between us and the strap
upset her into the flower bed. I was sorry
about it, but I thought we had better not stay
there any longer, so I turned and ran as hard
as I could, pulling Freya after me, toward the
orchard. The orchard is quite a large place
and one needn’t be caught there unless one
wants to. But Freya, of course, had to spoil
it all. When we came to a tree she went on
the other side of it and the strap held us there.
I told her to come around my side, but she
just whimpered and tugged at the strap and
paid no attention to what I said. Of course
I wasn’t going to give in to her whim, so I
pulled and pulled and would have pulled her
around the right way at last if William hadn’t
come up just then and caught us. We got a
cuffing, which was all Freya’s fault for being
so obstinate.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_1IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>WHEN I ATE MY COLLAR</small></h3>
</div>


<p>After that William put the strap on us every
day for a while and we got used to it. It
was all right as soon as Freya understood that
she was to go the way I wanted to go. But it
took her some time to do it. Freya is very
stupid at times. About a week after I got my
collar it was the cause of much pain to me.
The Baby took it off one day and laid it on
the ground. After she had gone I went back
and found it. There is something about
leather that I like. I didn’t mean to do any
harm to the collar, but it tasted very good and
so I closed my eyes and chewed and chewed
and chewed. Freya came and watched me and
asked me to give her some.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a collar of your own,” I
growled. “Go away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” she said. “But you’ll catch it.
Just you wait!”</p>

<p>She went off to bark at Ju-Ju, who was
asleep on a window-sill, and I thought of what
she had said. I looked at the collar. It was
a very sad looking collar. There wasn’t much
left except the brass tag. Freya was right; I
would catch it if any one saw it. So I took
what was left of it and dug a hole in a flower-bed
and buried it. Not ten minutes after that
the Mistress came out and called me. I made
believe I didn’t hear her, but it did no good,
for she kept on calling me and so I had to go
to her. When I got near her I rolled over on
my back and whined.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “you funny dog! I’m not
angry with you, even if you didn’t come as soon
as you should have. You’re a nice puppums
and—why, where’s your collar?”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything, of course. Instead I
pounced on a twig and shook it and ran around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
with it in my mouth. I thought perhaps she
would forget about the collar. But she didn’t
even smile.</p>

<p>“Naughty Fritz!” she said. “What have
you done with your collar?”</p>

<p>Freya came up and looked at me in a way
which said: “There! Now you are in for it!
And I’m glad, because you were selfish and
wouldn’t give me any.” And then she trotted
over to the Mistress with her tail curled up
very proudly as much as to say: “See what a
good dog I am! I haven’t lost my collar!”</p>

<p>“You wait till I catch you,” I growled.</p>

<p>Then the Baby came out and the Mistress
said: “Look, Baby, at what a naughty, bad dog
Fritz has been. He’s lost his nice new collar.”</p>

<p>Baby laughed and gurgled. “Collar!” she
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, and see how ashamed he looks.
Naughty dog!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“Mild’ed tooked it off,” said the Baby.</p>

<p>“You took it off? Oh, you shouldn’t have
done that, dear,” said the Mistress. “What
did you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Tooked it off!” said the Baby, and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>By that time William had come up, with a
rake in his hands, and the Mistress told him
about it. William scratched his head, which
is what he always does when he tries to think
very hard.</p>

<p>“Where were you when you took it off,
dear?” asked the Mistress.</p>

<p>The Baby toddled across to the lawn and we
all followed her. I pretended to be very much
surprised when we found that the collar wasn’t
there.</p>

<p>“Are you sure this is the place, dear?” asked
the Mistress.</p>

<p>The Baby nodded hard. “Mild’ed tooked
off collar!” she cried and looked very proud of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
herself. I hunted all around, but couldn’t find
anything but a small stone. So I took that to
the Mistress, but she just tossed it away.
Freya chased it. William scratched his head
some more.</p>

<p>“If she took it off him, mum,” he said, “it’s
gone by now. Sure, he chews up everything
he finds, he’s that de-struct-ive, mum.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what “de-struct-ive” meant,
but I didn’t like the sound of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” said the Mistress, looking
at me very hard. I turned my head away and
made believe I didn’t hear. Freya wagged
her tail and trotted off to the flower bed. I
watched her and growled.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we’ll find it,” said the Mistress.
“You’d better look around, William.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mum,” said William. Then he cried
“Hi, there! Stop that!” and ran over to the
flower bed where Freya was digging. By the
time he got to her she had the collar in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
mouth and was holding it out to him, wagging
her tail.</p>

<p>“Here it is, mum,” called William. “And
all chewed up, mum, just like I said, mum!”</p>

<p>I didn’t wait to hear any more, but very
quietly slipped away from them and ran for the
stable. But William found me. He dragged
me out by the scruff of my neck from behind a
pile of flower-pots and showed me the collar.
Then he—but I don’t like to think of what he
did. It was very painful. After he had gone
I cried myself to sleep behind the flower-pots
and slept quite a while. And when I woke
up again I didn’t come out until I was sure
that William had gone to his dinner. I was
very hungry, too, but I was afraid to go near
the house. So I went off to the meadow and
dug up a bone I had buried a long while before.
I heard them calling me to come to
dinner, but I didn’t go. I hoped they would
be sorry they had treated me as they had.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
After a while, though, they stopped calling
me. So I chewed on my bone, which was very
good but a little too dry. Still, when you’re
very hungry most any bone tastes good. After
that I felt much better and set off to find
Freya. I met my father in the stable yard
and asked him where she was, and he said she
was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Delia is giving her gingerbread because she
found your collar. If you go up there perhaps
they’ll give you some, too.”</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t want any,” I said.</p>

<p>“You don’t deserve any,” said Father.
“After this you will know better than to eat
your collar.”</p>

<p>I went on toward the house and lay down
behind a bush and waited. After awhile
Freya came out looking very pleased with herself.
She had a piece of cake in her mouth and
went over to the orchard to bury it because she
had had so much already she couldn’t eat it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
I followed her, keeping away from the house,
and went up to her very quietly while she was
digging a hole. When she saw me she dropped
the cake and tried to run, but I got her....</p>

<p>Afterwards I ate the cake.</p>

<p>Of course Freya told Mother that I had hurt
her. She’s such a tattle-tale! When I went
back to the stable Mother wanted to punish
me, but Father said: “No, Freya deserved
what she got. She should not have told on
Fritz.” So Mother said we were both very
bad children and we must go to the Kennel and
stay there until we could behave. So we went.
After a while Freya crawled over to me and
licked my ear and said she was sorry. I just
growled. So then she licked the other ear and
said she was sorry again, and I forgave her and
we made it up and went off together to the
pond to hunt frogs.</p>

<p>A day or two later William came with another
collar and wanted to put it on me, but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
ran as fast as I could and hid behind the flower-pots
again. I don’t know why I always went
there when I wanted to hide, because William
always found me right away, just as he did this
time. I whined a little when he pulled me out,
but he patted me and rubbed my neck and said
he wasn’t going to hurt me.</p>

<p>“Look at the fine new collar I have for you,”
he said. “Hold still now till I get it on.”</p>

<p>So I held still, as still as I could for trembling,
and he put it around my neck and
buckled it.</p>

<p>“There, now,” he said. “Aren’t you the
proud puppy? Sure, it looks fine on you.
Run along now and show it to your father and
mother. But don’t you be eating it up, mind!”</p>

<p>Just as though I would! Why, I’ve hated
the taste of collars ever since!</p>

<small>HOW I DUG FOR A BADGER</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Next door to us was a dog named Jack.
There was a wide field between our house and
Jack’s and so he lived quite a way from us.
But he used to come over to our place pretty
often and after we got big we went over to see
him. Jack and Father were great friends and
used to go hunting together. Jack was a
pointer and the first time I saw him I asked
Mother what sort of an animal he was, because
as he was so different from us I didn’t think
of his being a dog too. He had very long legs
and was white with brown spots, one on each
side of his head and one on each side of his
body and a little one where his tail began. He
was dreadfully big, ten times as big as Father,
and I was afraid of him at first. But I need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
not have been, for he was a very nice, kind
dog.</p>

<p><a href="#i_042">He was what the Family called a “bird dog.”</a>
When his Master went out with a gun to hunt
partridges or grouse Jack would go ahead and
scent the birds in the grass or bushes, and then
he would stand very still, with his tail pointing
straight out behind him and his nose pointing
straight out in front of him, and his Master
would know that there were partridges ahead
and say “Hie on!” Then Jack would creep
on very quietly and all of a sudden the birds
would fly up in the air and his Master’s gun
would go <em>bang-bang!</em> and then there would be
partridges for dinner. I thought it was very
clever of Jack and wondered why Father didn’t
hunt birds too. I asked Mother about it once
and she said:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="i_042">
  <img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_35">He was what the Family called a “bird dog”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Every dog to his trade, my dear. Jack is
a pointer and pointers were made to hunt birds.
Your father is a dachshund and dachshunds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
were made to hunt badgers and rabbits and
animals that live underground. Jack is a very
fine dog, but he couldn’t dig out a badger or a
fox or even a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, “could Father do that?”</p>

<p>“Of course, and so can I; and so can you
when you grow up. That’s why you are made
as you are. Badgers and foxes live in holes
that they make far under the ground. The
holes are small and they turn and twist, and
that’s why your body is made so long and your
legs so short; so that you can follow a fox or a
badger into his hole.”</p>

<p>“What is a badger?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A badger,” said Mother, “is a very savage
animal, much larger than your father. He
lives underground and comes out at night to
hunt. He has short legs and very long claws
and a long nose. He catches smaller animals
and eats them and sometimes he steals the
farmer’s chickens. He has a very loose skin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
just like yours, that is covered with fine grey
hairs. Folks make brushes out of the hairs.
The brush the Master lathers his face with in
the morning when he shaves is made of badger
hair and the brush that William used the other
day to paint the old wagon with is made of it
too.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could catch a badger,” I said.
Mother smiled.</p>

<p>“The first time you found one at the end of
his tunnel you might wish differently,” she
said. “Badgers fight hard, with tooth and
claw, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Are they more savage than foxes?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but no braver. A fox has only his
teeth to fight with but he makes good use of
them.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be afraid,” I boasted. “Are
there any badgers or foxes about here?”</p>

<p>“Foxes, yes, but no badgers that I have ever
heard of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“There are rabbits, though,” I said. “Some
day I shall catch me a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, my dear. Rabbits are harmless
and they can’t fight underground. We
have no quarrel with rabbits, we dachshunds.”</p>

<p>“Then,” I said, “I’ll have to find a fox.”</p>

<p>“It will be a good while before you are big
enough to bring a fox out of his hole,” said
Mother. “Some day, though, you shall try
it, perhaps. You have good digging paws,
Fritz.”</p>

<p>“They—they’re awfully big,” I said.</p>

<p>“As they should be, my dear. They’re made
for digging. Each one is a little shovel, or,
rather, a hoe. When you go into a hole that
isn’t big enough you begin to dig. And that
is why your front legs are made so crooked.
If they were straight you would throw the dirt
right under you. As they are, with your feet
turning out, they throw the dirt on each side of
you, out of your way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me that,” I said, “because
I’ve always wondered about my legs and
feet and been a little ashamed of them. They
seemed so funny and crooked and big. Now
I see that they are just as they should be.” I
looked at my feet quite proudly. “I guess,” I
said, “I’ll go and dig a hole somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mother, stretching herself
out to go to sleep, “but keep away from the
flower beds, Fritz.”</p>

<p>So I found a field-mouse hole at the root
of an apple tree in the orchard and dug and
dug and had got down so far that only my
tail was sticking out when Freya came
along.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” she asked. She
might have seen for herself that I was digging
a hole, but she is always asking silly questions
like that.</p>

<p>“I’m digging for a badger,” I said. “Want
to help?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed!” cried Freya. “Is there
really a badger down there?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” I said. “You don’t
suppose I’d be digging a hole as deep as this
one if there wasn’t something there, do you?”
So I crawled out and Freya got in and went
to work. I looked on a minute and then I
said:</p>

<p>“You don’t dig very well, do you? I suppose
your feet aren’t big enough.”</p>

<p>“They’re as big as yours,” said Freya, stopping
to rest.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t know how to use them,” I
said. “Digging is an art, and not every
dachshund knows how.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Freya. “Let me see you do
it, then.”</p>

<p>So I got back in the hole and dug as hard as
ever I could, and the dirt just flew out, I tell
you! “There,” I said at last, much out of
breath, “that’s the way to do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>But when I looked around, would you believe
it, that silly dog had gone! And there
was William hurrying up with a stick in his
hand.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re doing?” he cried,
real crossly. “Trying to dig up that apple
tree? Get out o’ that, you pesky critter!”</p>

<p>So I got out in a big hurry and ran off
around the house and down to the stable and
crept behind the flower-pots. For once William
didn’t find me and, as I was very tired, I
went to sleep and dreamed that I had crawled
down a long, long hole in the ground and that
in front of me was a horrible grey badger with
long teeth and glaring yellow eyes and great
sharp claws. And when I tried to turn around
and run out I couldn’t because the hole was
too small, and when I tried to back out I
couldn’t because the dirt had fallen in around
me. And the badger said: “Hah, you’re the
smart young dog who said he wanted to catch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a badger, aren’t you?” And I said: “N-no,
sir, that—that was my brother.” “You’re fibbing,”
said the badger, “and for that I shall
eat you all up. <em>Raow!</em>” Then he crept
toward me and just as he reached out one great
big paw with dozens and dozens of ugly, sharp
claws I woke up with a howl, shivering and
shaking! And, oh, my, wasn’t I glad to see
those flower-pots and know that I was in the
stable and not in a long, deep hole with a
badger coming at me! I ran out and found
Mother and cuddled up very close to her and
told her my dream. She just smiled and licked
my eyes and pretty soon I went to sleep again
in the sunlight.</p>

<small>THE FROG WHO WAS A TOAD</small></h3>
</div>


<p>When I thought about it afterwards it seemed
strange that I should not be allowed to dig
holes when digging holes was what I was for.
But every time I did it some one, William or
the Master or the Mistress, came up and said
“No, no, Fritz! Naughty dog! Mustn’t dig
up the ground.” It was most discouraging.
(Discouraging is a long word, and if you
don’t know what it means I shan’t tell you.
Any one as old as you are ought to know.)
Freya never got in trouble that way. She
didn’t seem to care much for doing the things
I did, like digging for badgers in the orchard
or for foxes on the front lawn. (I know now
that I should not have expected to find a fox
under the lawn, but then one place seemed as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
good as another.) Freya liked to stay around
the back door and look hungry and coax Delia
or Cook to give her things to eat. When she
wasn’t doing that she was most always asleep
somewhere. She got very fat and lazy and it
was all I could do to get her to go hunting
with me. She wasn’t much good at hunting,
anyway. She always got tired just when the
fun began.</p>

<p>We used to go down to the pond and the
brook and hunt frogs. Frogs aren’t good to
eat, but it is a lot of fun chasing them. You
creep up on them very quietly along the edge
of the pond and try to get them before they
can jump back into the water. Most always
you miss them, because their eyes are in the
wrong place, being on the top of their head,
and they can see behind them. But sometimes
you catch one. When you do you play
with it awhile and let it go. Freya, though,
never would play with them. She said they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
were ugly-looking and she didn’t like the smell
of them. Girl-dogs are like that, though, sort
of finicky and fussy about little things.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t think that such a silly, no-account
animal as a frog could get a decent dog
into trouble, would you? It can, though, and
it did. And I was the dog. I’ll tell you about
it because it may be a warning to you some
time when you are hunting frogs.</p>

<p>One afternoon when it was very hot weather
and we had all kept very quiet in the shade
most of the day I got tired of keeping still
and told Freya to get up and we’d hunt frogs.
She didn’t want to at all, being, as I’ve said,
fat and lazy, but I nipped her ear and made
her. So we trotted down the road and across
the meadow, and when we were still a long
way from the pond I saw a frog. I told Freya
to be quiet and then I stole ahead very softly
and there he was in the grass just sitting and
looking at me out of two big goggly eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
He was quite different from any frog I’d ever
seen before, being fatter and uglier and having
more warts.</p>

<p>Freya whispered, “Oh, isn’t he horrid?
Don’t touch him, Fritz!” But I wasn’t going
to let any frog make faces at me and so I
jumped for him and caught him. He tried to
get away but I took him in my mouth and shook
him just in play, of course, and then—Oh dear,
the most awful thing happened! The inside
of my mouth got on fire and I dropped that
frog and ran as hard as ever I could run to
the pond and stuck my head right into the
water!</p>

<p>But water didn’t do much good. My
mouth and my tongue were hot and stingy
and smarty and felt just as though they were
burning up. I drank water and shook my
head and pawed my mouth and howled just as
loud as I could. Freya ran around and asked
what the matter was and got awfully excited.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
I was too busy trying to stop the pain to tell
her what was wrong. Besides, when I wasn’t
gulping water or pawing at my mouth I was
howling! Father and Mother heard me and
came running down to the pond. But I
couldn’t tell them what the matter was and
so Freya showed them the frog. I was still
sitting up to my neck in the pond and howling
frightfully when they came back.</p>

<p>“Stop making that noise,” said Father, “and
keep your mouth in the water.”</p>

<p>So I did it and whimpered instead of howled
and my mouth began to feel better. But my
tongue was swollen all up and when I tried
to talk I just made funny noises. After a
while I crawled out of the pond and shook
myself, feeling sort of ashamed because I had
made such a fuss. But Mother licked my face,
and Freya, who had been lying nearby whining,
came running up and leaped about and
barked. Even Father seemed sorry for me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Then he took us back to the frog, which was
still sitting where I had left him, and said:</p>

<p>“Have a good look at him, children.”</p>

<p>So we looked at the frog and the frog
blinked at us and seemed to be laughing. I
growled and backed away from him.</p>

<p>“The next time you take a frog in your
mouth,” said Father, “be sure it <em>is</em> a frog and
not a toad. Toads are very unhealthy for dogs
and that thing there is a toad. When you
took him up he put poison in your mouth. It
was a good thing you were near the pond, for
water is the only thing I know of that will
help. I heard of a dog once who was poisoned
by a frog and there was no water around and
so he ran for home. The poison made froth in
his mouth and Two-Legged Folks thought he
was mad and a policeman tried to shoot him.
Luckily for him the policeman aimed wrong
and the dog got away. Now do you think you
will know a toad the next time you see one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>I said I was sure of it and then we went home
and I crawled behind the flower-pots and
stayed there a long time. I didn’t want any
supper that day. You wouldn’t have wanted
any, either, if your mouth had felt the way
mine did. I think it is quite wrong to have
things look so much alike as frogs and toads
do; and flies and bees, too. How is a puppy
to know?</p>

<p>When it was almost dark I crept out from
behind the flower-pots and went to get a
drink of water. Ju-Ju was outside, playing
with a beetle, and when she saw me she grinned.
She must have found out somehow about that
toad. I hate cats.</p>

<small>THE CROSS DUCK</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The next day my mouth and tongue were
quite well once more, but it was more than a
week before I got brave enough to hunt frogs
again. In fact, I have never cared for frog-hunting
very much since, and I only did it
after that just to show Freya that I wasn’t
afraid to. But I couldn’t get her to go with
me. She’s rather a coward, Freya is. Just
look at the time I scared the duck! The way
she acted then made me quite ashamed of her!</p>

<p>That was months before I made the mistake
about the toad and I was younger and
sillier. I told you that there were ducks on
our place. Well, they lived in a house next
door to where the chickens were, and in the
day time they all waddled out as soon as William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
opened the gate for them and went down
to the pond. They are stupid things, ducks.
They don’t do anything all day long but waddle
around and wag their tails and eat and
swim and say “quack!” I don’t know what
“quack” means and I don’t believe they do,
for they always say it just the same way and
no matter what happens. If they see William
with their dinner they say “quack” and if they
see a chicken-hawk sailing about they say
“quack” and if I so much as look at them—from
a distance—they say “quack” just the
same. I don’t believe “quack” means a thing.
They just want you to think it does.</p>

<p>Well, one day I was trotting around by myself
looking for something to do when I caught
sight of a duck sitting in the grass on the side
of the brook quite a ways beyond the pond.
She didn’t see me because she had her head
hidden under her wing in the silly way ducks
have. It had been a very dull day so far and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
wanted some fun. So I thought it would be
a good joke to creep up on Mrs. Duck and
give her a good scare and see if she would say
anything more than just “Quack!”</p>

<p>Well, I did. I crept up very, very softly
and when I was about two feet away I said
“<em>Bow-wow!</em>” as loudly as I could. Mrs. Duck
gave a start, pulled her head out and said
“<em>Quack!</em>” much louder than I had said “Bow-wow!”
And then, before I knew what she was
up to, she spread her wings very wide and
jumped right at me!</p>

<p>It—well, it sort of surprised me, because I
didn’t know ducks did that. Besides, with her
wings all spread open like that and her mouth
very wide open, too, she looked almost as big
as ten ducks! So—so I sort of backed away,
not because I was afraid of her but just because
I was so surprised. Besides, I’d had my fun
and was ready to go away, anyhow. But she
didn’t seem to understand that it was all just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
a joke and she came right at me, saying
“<em>Quack! Quack! Quack!</em>” quite crossly. So I
kept on backing away, and the faster I backed
the faster she came for me and the louder she
“quacked!”</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly how it happened, but I
got between Mrs. Duck and the brook. I
didn’t know it, of course, or I should have
backed another way. Another thing I didn’t
know—and I wished I had known it—was that
she had a nest full of eggs there and was hatching
out some little ducks. If I had known
that I would not have gone near her. But I
didn’t know it until afterwards. So I kept
on backing and she kept on “quacking” and
making dabs at me with her yellow bill and
flapping her wings and <a href="#i_052fp">all of a sudden I
backed right over the side of the bank into the
brook!</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_052fp">
  <img src="images/i_052fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_53">All of a sudden I backed right over the side of the bank
into the brook!</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There was not much water in the brook and
I sat right down in a lot of soft, sticky mud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Of course I tried to get out, but the more I
tried the faster I stuck in that nasty mud.
And all the time that horrid, quarrelsome duck
stood on the bank and said “Quack!” and
scolded me. I was afraid she might come in
after me, and that is why I tried so very hard
to get out. But she didn’t. She just stood
there and said a lot of mean things to me while
the mud got stickier and stickier. And then
I howled. Any one would have howled. I
didn’t howl because I was afraid. I howled
because I couldn’t get my feet out of the mud.
No dog likes to be stuck in horrid black mud.
Pretty soon Freya came and looked over the
edge of the bank at me. But she didn’t come
very near where Mrs. Duck stood.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “what are you doing down
there, Fritz? William will be very angry with
you for getting so dirty. You’d better come
right out and take a bath in the pond before
you go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t get out!” I howled. “I’m stuck
in this mud. Help me!”</p>

<p>But Freya looked at the duck, who was still
“quacking” at a great rate, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid of her,” said Freya.</p>

<p>“Afraid of a duck!” I said. “Well, I’d be
ashamed to own it!” But I kept a watch on
the duck because I was afraid she might understand
what I said. She didn’t though. “Bark
at her and scare her away,” I told Freya.
“She—she won’t hurt you. Ducks are great
cowards.”</p>

<p>But Freya shook her head again. “I—I
don’t like her looks,” she said. “Couldn’t you—couldn’t
you pull yourself out if you tried
very hard?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t,” I snapped. “If I could I
wouldn’t be here now. If you can’t help me
out of here you’d better run home and tell
Mother. You’re an awful scare-baby!”</p>

<p>So Freya walked two or three steps toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the duck and said “Bow-wow!” just as if she
was frightened to death, which she was, and
the duck paid no attention to her at all. Then
Freya went a little nearer and barked again.
That time Mrs. Duck heard her and turned
around and made straight for her. Freya
gave one awful yelp, tucked her tail between
her legs and flew. And the duck went after
her, flapping her wings and “quacking!” And
somehow just then I managed to get a front
paw on a stone at the side of the brook and
dragged myself out. And when I got to the
top of the bank Freya was half-way across the
meadow, still yelping, and Mrs. Duck was
waddling back again.</p>

<p>I didn’t stay there long, I can tell you. Not
that I was afraid of that stupid old duck, but I
wanted to get the mud off me before it dried
on. So I hurried back to the pond. But
when I got there it was full of other ducks and
they looked at me so queerly that I thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
I’d better not go into the pond after all. So
I sneaked back to the stable, thinking I’d get
behind the flower-pots before any one could see
me. But just as I came to the door who
should come out but William!</p>

<p>“<em>Well!</em>” he said, just like that; “<em>Well!</em>” I
made a dash for the corner where the flower-pots
were and got there, but he hauled me right
out by my neck and held me at arm’s length
and looked at me. “I never see a dirtier pup,”
he said. “Where have you been?” Of course
I didn’t tell him and he said: “Well, wherever
you’ve been I know where you’re going.
You’re going into the tub!”</p>

<p>What followed was awful. William filled
the tub in the stable half-full of cold water
and put me in it. I thought at first I would
drown, but he held me up with one hand and
lathered me all over with harness soap with
the other. And then he took a horrid, stiff
brush and scrubbed me until it hurt. The soap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
got in my eyes and smarted and it got into my
mouth and tasted badly, and all the time William
scolded.</p>

<p>I had to cry a little. You’d have cried too.
I’ve heard you cry when Nurse got soap in
your eyes, and you needn’t pretend you haven’t.
Besides, it was all very unfair. I didn’t want
to fall in the mud and get dirty. It was all
that duck’s fault. But William just blamed
it all on me without trying to find out how it
really happened, and I had to suffer. Once
I caught sight of Freya peeking around the
corner of the door and I said to myself: “Just
you wait till I get out of here, if I ever do,
and see what will happen to you, Miss!”</p>

<p>But when, after a long, long time, William
thought he could not get any more dirt off
me and so put me out on the floor, and when
I had shaken myself half a dozen times, felt
so good that I forgot all about the way Freya<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
had behaved and ran circles and barked until
I was almost dry. Then I found a nice warm
spot against the side of the stable and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>But even if I did forgive Freya that time
you can see that she behaved very badly and
is not at all brave. Still, I suppose that being
a girl dog has a lot to do with it. You mustn’t
expect a girl-dog to be as brave as a boy-dog.</p>

<p>That was my first real bath. I’ve had many
since then and I’ve grown to put up with
them just as one must put up with castor-oil and
pills. But I’m sure I shall never get fond of
them. I don’t mind wading in the pond or
even swimming a little, but baths are quite different.
Besides, I am not a water-dog, like a
spaniel or a retriever, and folks ought to think
of that. They don’t, though. About once a
month I have to go through with it, and the
mere sight of a cake of soap quite takes my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
appetite away for hours. I once heard the
Mistress tell the man who comes for the laundry
that she wanted something “dry-cleaned.”
I wonder why dogs can’t be dry-cleaned too!</p>

<small>THE OLD LADY WHO DIDN’T LIKE DOGS</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Are you scared of thunder storms? I am, too.
Well, not exactly scared, maybe, but I—I
don’t like them very well. I don’t mind the
lightning so much, but the thunder is very
noisy and it affects my nerves. I am quite a
nervous dog. All highly-bred dogs are nervous,
you know. And when you can trace your
family back for dozens of years, the way I can,
you have every right to dislike thunder. Perhaps
you didn’t know I had such a long pedigree?
Mother told us all about it once. We
are descended from Hansel von Konigsberg,
who was the Champion of all Germany for
many years and quite the finest dachshund that
ever lived. He won all sorts of prizes wherever
he was shown and was a very fine, proud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
dog. Every one in Germany knows about
Hansel von Konigsberg. Mother says it is a
fine thing to be descended from such a dog and
that I should always try to live up to it. Well,
that isn’t telling about the time I got under
the bed in the guest-room when there was a
thunder storm, is it?</p>

<p>There were visitors at the house, and one
was an elderly lady who wore a black silk
dress and had her eye-glasses on a little stick.
When she saw us puppies she held the glasses
up to her eyes and looked at us just as though
we were something quite strange. “Dear me,”
she said, “what ugly little things. What are
they?” The Master laughed and told her we
were dachshund puppies. “You mean they’re
dogs?” she asked. “Why, they look like alligators!
Don’t let them come near me, please.
I never could stand dogs, anyway, and these
are quite—quite disgusting!”</p>

<p>Neither Freya or I knew then what an alligator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
was, but we didn’t like the sound of it.
Besides, she had said we were ugly and disgusting.
So I looked at Freya and Freya
looked at me and we made a rush for the Old
Lady Who Didn’t Like Dogs and jumped all
over her. Of course we made believe we were
awfully pleased to see her, but we weren’t.
She gave a screech and dropped her eye-glasses.
They were on a black ribbon, though,
and so they didn’t break. But I got the ribbon
in my teeth and laid back and pulled and
growled, and Freya took hold of the old lady’s
skirt and shook it. And all the time the old
lady said “Shoo! Shoo, you nasty little brutes!
Oh, somebody take them away!”</p>

<p>So the Master caught me and made believe
spank me and the Mistress caught Freya and
told her she was a naughty dog, and we both
ran off, making believe we were very sorry
and scared, and the old lady hurried into the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Afterward Freya and I laid down under the
lilac hedge and talked it over. We decided
that we didn’t like the old lady and that we’d
wait there until she came out again to see the
garden and then we’d make another dash for
her and scare her again. But she didn’t come
back and it was pretty hot and so we both fell
fast asleep there.</p>

<p>When we woke up it was quite late in the
afternoon and the sky was cloudy and there
was a rumbly noise that sounded like thunder.
Freya whined and said she was afraid. I told
her not to be a silly; that thunder never
hurt any one. She said the lightning might,
though, and she was going to the stable and
crawl under the hay. She wanted me to go
with her, but of course it would not have done
to let Freya think I was frightened too, and
so I said, No, I was going to stay where I
was. Freya ran to the stable and just when
she got to it there was a most awful crash of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
thunder and I forgot how brave I was and
looked for a place to hide.</p>

<p>Well, William had taken the screen-door off
that morning, to mend a place Freya and I had
torn in the wire, and the other door happened
to be open. So I looked around very carefully
and then ran into the big room. Just then
there was more thunder and a flash of lightning
and I hid under the couch. But I knew that
wouldn’t do because some one would surely
find me there and put me out. So I listened
and didn’t hear any one and went upstairs very
quietly. And when I got to the top of the
stairs there was a door open and I went in and
crept under the bed. It was nice and dark
there and I couldn’t see the lightning. But
every time it thundered I trembled and whined
and had a pretty bad time of it. I could hear
the rain drumming on the tin roof outside, and
it seemed to me that the storm lasted for hours.
But after a while it stopped and the thunder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
got farther and farther away and at last it died
out in little growls and grumbles and I rolled
over on my side and went to sleep, quite worn
out.</p>

<p>When I awoke I heard some one moving
around in the room and just to be friendly I
thumped my tail on the floor. Then some one
came near the bed and looked under. It was
too dark to see who the person was, but I
thumped harder than before, and, will you believe
it, it was that Old Lady Who Didn’t Like
Dogs! She gave a most horrible scream and
just flew through the door into the hall. Why,
she almost scared me out of a year’s growth!
She cried “Help! Help! There’s some one
under my bed!” and I heard the Master shout
from his room and come running. And the
first thing I knew the room was full of folks
and the old lady was telling how she had heard
a noise and had looked down and seen two
“fierce yellow eyes glaring at her.” Delia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
shouted “’Tis a burglar, mum! We’ll all be
murdered, sir!” But the Master told her to
be quiet.</p>

<p>“I dare say it is only the cat,” he said, and
then he knelt down and looked under the bed
and I thumped my tail harder than ever and
the Master sat right down on the floor and
laughed and laughed! Then the Mistress said:</p>

<p>“What is it, George? Do stop that silly
laughing! Is it Ju-ju?”</p>

<p>So the Master reached in and pulled me out
by the scruff of my neck and held me up.
“Here’s your burglar,” he said. And then
they all laughed; all except the Old Lady Who
Didn’t Like Dogs. She was very angry about
it.</p>

<p>“I am glad you all think it so funny,” she
said with a sniff. “For my part I fail to see
the humour. And what is more I refuse to
remain in a house where I am to be pestered by
dogs and scared out of my wits every minute.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
I’m thankful my trunk is not fully unpacked.”</p>

<p>But she didn’t go, after all, for which Freya
and I were sorry. And even though we
stayed around the house a lot in the hope that
she would come out so we could run at her and
jump on her, she didn’t once set her foot off
the piazza, and all we could do was get close
to the screen and growl at her. The Mistress
said: “It’s too bad you don’t like dogs, Miss
Mumford, they’re such company for one, and
living alone as you do a dog would be a great
comfort to you. Just see the little dears begging
to be let in. Wasn’t it funny how they
took to you at once the day you came? They
seem quite fond of you.”</p>

<p>And the Mistress glanced at me and then
smiled at the thing she was sewing on. And
Freya and I looked at each other and laughed.
And the Old Lady Who Didn’t Like Dogs said
“Humph!” Just like that.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_1IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>THE LITTLE BOY FROM THE CITY</small></h3>
</div>


<p>More company came after that. It was in
the Fall, when the leaves were turning to beautiful
colours and falling off the trees and when
the mornings and nights were quite cool and
the best place to take a nap was in the stable
doorway where the sun shone warmly on the
floor. Freya and I were about six months old
then and were getting to be pretty big for
puppies. We weren’t as big as Father or
Mother, but when we romped with either of
them Freya and I together could do just about
as we pleased with them. Lots of times
Mother used to run away from us because we
were so strong that we could roll her over on
her back and bite her and shake her until she
yelped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Others had grown up, too. All the fluffy
little yellow chicks that Freya and I used to
watch through the chicken yard wires were
quite big, almost as big as their parents. And
all the little ducklings had grown up into
ducks and could say “Quack!” just like their
mothers and fathers. In the garden the flowers
had gone, all but a few, and it was a great
relief to me. I was always very fond of flowers
and liked to pick them and eat them, but
William didn’t like me to and would get after
me whenever he caught me at it. I got a lot of
cuffings on account of my love for flowers. I
couldn’t understand why it was they were so
selfish with them when they had so many. It
seemed to me that one or two more or less
would not have made any difference. But
Two-Legged Folks are peculiar in many ways.
They aren’t nearly so sensible as dogs.</p>

<p>Even the Baby was getting bigger and older.
She could talk quite nicely by Fall, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
you had to listen very closely to understand all
she said. You see, she talked very quickly and
ran her words together. It was the Baby who
told me about the company coming. It was
one morning on the piazza. The screens had
been taken off then and the Baby and I were
in the hammock together. Freya didn’t like
the hammock. She said it made her feel funny
inside when it swung. I did, though. It was
full of nice soft cushions and I was very proud
when I found one day that I could jump up
on it all by myself and didn’t have to be lifted
up or pulled up any more. Well, the Baby
and I were there together, swinging, and she
was pulling my ears the way she liked to do,
and chatting all the time. I wasn’t paying
very much attention to what she was saying
because I was a little bit sleepy. It always
makes me sleepy to have my ears pulled.
Well, pretty soon the Baby said:</p>

<p>“Booful little boy’s coming to play wiv Mild’ed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
All way f’om City. Coming to-day, I
dess.”</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears then. At least, I
pricked up one of them, the one that wasn’t
being pulled. I had never seen a little boy
very near, but I had heard Mother speak of
them and from what she had said I didn’t think
I should like them. So I didn’t look very
pleased at what the Baby said. Perhaps she
saw it, for she went on:</p>

<p>“Is very nice little boy. Is coming all way
f’om City to play wiv Mild’ed. Little boy’s
name is A’fed.”</p>

<p>I thought Afed was a very silly name for
any one, even a boy. I found out afterwards
that his name was Alfred, but I didn’t like it
much better. I hoped he would be nicer than
his name. The Baby talked on about him for
a long time and I pretended to listen. Finally
I got tired hearing about him and jumped
down and went away. I made up my mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
that I wasn’t going to like A’fred, and when I
told Freya she made up her mind she wasn’t
going to like him either. We decided that we
would bite his legs when he came.</p>

<p>William drove to the railway station to meet
Alfred and his mother, and Freya went along.
William was very partial to Freya and used
to take her with him quite often. He took me
once and said he would never do it again because
I barked at everything I saw and fell out
of the carriage. I didn’t mean to fall out,
though, and it hurt a good deal. Anyhow,
he took Freya with him that day and I
found a warm place on a flower bed beside the
house and waited for them to come back. William
didn’t like to have us lie on the flower
beds, even after the flowers were through
blooming, but I knew he wouldn’t see me and
I meant to go away when I heard the carriage
coming up the drive.</p>

<p>But it was so warm there and the earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
smelled so nice that I fell asleep. When I
woke up the first thing I did was to howl and
the next thing to run. Because William had
come back without my hearing him and had
crept over to me, and what had wakened me
up was the carriage whip! I thought it was
rather a mean thing to surprise me like that.
When I had stopped hurting and running I
looked back and there was the little boy with
Freya in his arms going into the house. And,
would you believe it, Freya was actually licking
his face! Isn’t that like a girl-dog, to
break her promise the very first thing? Just
pat Freya and she thinks you are perfectly
lovely and follows you all around. For my
part, I’d have more self-respect and pride.
Folks can’t make friends with me by just patting
my head and saying “Nice doggie!” No,
sir!</p>

<p>I was quite disgusted with Freya and I told
her so later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Alfred’s mother was a very sweet looking
lady and I knew right away I should like her.
I did, too. Not two hours afterwards she
came out to see us and fed us peppermint
drops. I am very fond of peppermint drops
because they make your tongue feel sort of
cold and tingley, and I liked the lady at once.
Oh, not just because of the candy, of course,
but because she was nice to look at and understood
dogs and loved them. We can tell right
off whether a person likes us. Alfred came
out with his mother, and the Baby followed
Alfred. She wouldn’t let him out of her sight
and paid almost no attention to me. Alfred
was really rather nice looking, for a boy, with
golden hair, dark eyes and a sun-burned face.
He was older than the Baby. When he saw
me he cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s another of them! Come here,
puppy! What’s your name?”</p>

<p>Of course I paid no heed to him. I meant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
to show Freya that I had more sense than to
grovel to folks just because they whistled to
me and paid me a little attention! When he
saw that I didn’t mean to come to him he
started after me, and I showed my teeth and
growled. He stopped then and made a face
at me. “You’re not as nice as the other one,”
he said. Then he picked up a pebble and
threw it at me and I growled again. “What’s
this one’s name, Mildred?” he asked the Baby.</p>

<p>“He name F’itz. Him booful dogums!”</p>

<p>Alfred laughed. “Fits! That’s a funny
name, isn’t it? Does he have them often?”</p>

<p>“She means Fritz, dear,” said his mother.
“Here, Fritz, come and see me.”</p>

<p>So I went, but I wouldn’t let Alfred touch
me, and he didn’t like it a bit. He fed candy
to Freya and she fairly licked his shoes! Girl-dogs
have no pride. It so disgusted me that I
turned right around and went down to the
stable and crawled behind the flower-pots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>Even Father and Mother seemed to like
Alfred, and they and Freya played with him
and the Baby a lot. I didn’t. I stayed away.
It was pretty lonesome, though. Now and
then Alfred would try to make friends with
me. He begged cake from Cook and tried to
get me to take it, but I wouldn’t. I’m fond
of cake, too. I spent a good deal of time behind
the flower-pots those days. You see I
was afraid that some time when I was fearfully
hungry Alfred would offer me cake and I’d
take it. And I didn’t want to, for I had made
up my mind not to be friends with him. One
morning he and the Baby came out of the house
when we were having breakfast at the back
door and called to us. Of course Father and
Mother and Freya trotted right over to them,
but I stayed and made believe I had found
something more to eat in the dish. When
Freya saw that she came back, but I growled
at her and she went off again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Come, F’itz!” called the Baby. “Come
F’itz, booful dogums!”</p>

<p>And Alfred called me too, but I wouldn’t
go, and finally Alfred said: “Oh, come on.
We don’t want him anyway!”</p>

<p>So they went off toward the orchard to hunt
squirrels. Of course I felt pretty lonesome
and wanted to go with them very much.
Hunting squirrels is awfully exciting, even
though we never catch any. I licked the
breakfast dish quite clean and then went to the
corner of the house and peeked around. They
were all over in the orchard and Father was
barking at a great rate, making believe he had
found a fox’s nest or something, and Freya was
trotting behind Alfred and trying to lick his
hand. The Baby was toddling along, laughing,
and Mother was barking at a bird. It
looked very jolly and I crept along after them,
keeping out of sight.</p>

<p>They didn’t find any squirrels. I never saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
but one in the orchard and he wasn’t much to
look at, having almost no hair on his tail. But
we always pretended the trees were full of
them. After they had been all around the
orchard they climbed the wall on the other side,
which they were not allowed to do, and went
into the thicket over there where the ground
is all soft and squishy. I could have told
them that they would soon find themselves in
trouble, and I came very near barking and
warning them, but I didn’t. It was no affair
of mine.</p>

<p>After a bit I heard Alfred shout and then
Mother barked and the Baby began to cry and
I knew just what had happened. I went back
to the house and sat on the lawn and waited,
and pretty soon they came back looking very
sorrowful. The Baby had fallen down in the
swamp and she was covered with black mud
from head to toes. Alfred was leading her
with one hand and trying to wipe off the mud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
with the other, and Freya, who never knows
when she isn’t wanted, was getting in the way
and barking and acting perfectly stupid.
Father and Mother stayed behind, trying to
look as if nothing much had happened. When
they all passed me I just looked at them without
a word and I can tell you they felt silly!
The Mistress saw them from a window and
came hurrying out to meet them, and Alfred’s
mother came out, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mildred, what have you done?” cried
the Mistress. “Just see that nice clean dress
I put on you not half an hour ago!”</p>

<p>“She—she fell down in the mud over there,”
said Alfred. “We—we were hunting Indians.”</p>

<p>Did you ever hear anything so foolish?
Just as though there were any Indians around
there! Even if there had been Freya and I
would soon have scared them away. Well,
the Mistress led the Baby into the house and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Alfred’s mother said: “Alfred, come with me,
please,” and Alfred said “Yes’m,” in a voice
that seemed to come from his shoes. Father
and Mother went down to the stable in a hurry
and Freya came over and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>“A nice thing you did,” I said.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault,” said Freya with a
whine.</p>

<p>“You should have watched out for the
Baby,” I said sternly. “You’ll catch it when
the Mistress finds you.”</p>

<p>So Freya suddenly remembered that she had
left a bone behind the stable and trotted off
after it, looking back now and then at the front
door. Presently Alfred came out all alone.
He had one arm over his eyes, but he couldn’t
fool me. I knew he was crying. I guess his
mother had whipped him, or maybe just
scolded him, for letting the Baby fall in the
mud. He didn’t see me and he went around
the house and sat down on the back door-step<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and sniffled. I followed him. If you don’t
like a person you enjoy seeing them cry. At
least, you ought to, I think. But Alfred kept
on crying kind of softly, just as though his
heart was broken, and I couldn’t stand it. I
wanted to go away and leave him there, but—but
somehow I couldn’t do that either.</p>

<p>So after a bit I crept over to him and got up
on the step beside him and licked his face. He
peeked out and saw it was me and was so surprised
that he forgot to cry for a minute.
Then he put his arm around me and I licked
his face some more and—and, oh, well, after
that we liked each other a lot.</p>

<p>Mother said afterwards that it was just
jealousy that had kept me away, and I guess
it was. Alfred stayed a whole week after that
and <a href="#i_frontis">we had some fine times together</a>. When
he went back to the City I missed him a great
deal. The place seemed very lonely. I think
I missed him almost as much as the Baby did,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and the Baby cried all one day. I tried my
best to comfort her and I licked her nose and
her cheeks and her ears, but it didn’t do much
good. She kept right on saying that she
wanted her “booful A’fed.” The Mistress
told her that she would see him again very
soon because they were all going to the City to
stay a long, long time. But that didn’t help
me any, because I was quite sure they wouldn’t
take me.</p>

<p>And they didn’t. They all went off, bag
and baggage, about a week later, and only
William and Cook and Delia were left.
Mother and I were very sad and lonesome at
first. I don’t think Father minded so much,
because he and William were great chums, and
as for Freya, why, as long as she had enough
to eat and some one to say “Good dog” to her,
she didn’t care what happened. But Mother
and I missed the Baby a whole lot, and the
Mistress too, and the Master not so much because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
he was busy a good deal of the time and
we saw less of him.</p>

<p>And then one day we woke up and the world
was all white, and Mother said it had snowed in
the night. And William picked up some of
the white stuff and made a ball of it and threw
it at Delia at the back door. And Delia
squealed and ran inside. William said:
“Well, well, winter’s here at last!”</p>

<p>I think I have told you enough for now.
You have almost fallen asleep two or three
times. Besides, it is time for my nap. I always
like a short nap before dinner. And
really I have talked an awful lot. I hope you
liked my story.</p>

<small>HOW WE WENT HUNTING</small></h3>
</div>


<p>Bow!</p>

<p>So you want to hear some more of my story,
do you? Very well. It’s a very good day to
sit here by the fire and tell stories, because it
is raining hard and there isn’t much a dog can
do in the City on a rainy day. For my part
I think cities are rather stupid places, anyway.
Of course, on bright days, there’s the
Park and the Avenue, and I like those very
much. But it’s a bother always having to be
on a leash. When I see a dog on the other
side of the street whom I am quite sure I should
like to know, all I can do is just say “Hello!”
In the country I could trot over to him and
make friends and, like as not, we’d go off on a
nice long hunt in the woods. There’s lots to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
see in the City, but it is awfully noisy and
crowded and at first it made me quite nervous.
I’m getting used to it now. I do think it’s a
mistake to have so little yard about the house,
though, especially when it is paved with stone
and brick. Even the stable floor is stone and
I’m sure there are some fine fat rats under
it if I could only get at them. Why, I haven’t
had but one good dig since I got here! And
that was that day in the Park when the big
Policeman came running over, waving a funny
short stick at us, and said he would have us
both taken to jail if I didn’t stop digging.</p>

<p>Yes, I do miss the digging. The other day
I made believe I smelled a fox in the corner of
the back hall and was scratching away at the
boards and having a real good time when Cook
came and drove me away. I forgave her,
though, for she gave me a chicken leg to eat.
I <em>do</em> have good things to eat here; better than
I used to in the country; more different kinds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of things, anyway. And a dog likes variety
as well as you Two-Legged Folks do. I don’t
want you to think I am at all unhappy here,
for I am not. If only there was a garden bed
to dig in now and then I wouldn’t ask for more.
And, anyhow, what a dog wants most is love
and kindness, and I get lots of that. I guess
I don’t care about the flower bed. Excuse me
just a moment while I lick your face.</p>

<p>Well, I left off where the Family had gone
to the City, didn’t I? We dogs had a good
deal of fun in that snow. It was the first snow
I had ever seen and I had a fine time running
around in it and biting it. Freya said it made
her paws cold and she sat in the stable door
and just looked at it and shivered until I
chased her out and rolled her over in it. After
that she didn’t mind it a bit. William made
snowballs and threw them for us to chase. It
was great fun for they went into the snow,
quite out of sight, and we had to burrow down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and dig them out. And then when we tried to
take them in our teeth to bring them back to
William they would fall to pieces!</p>

<p>After that there was no more snow for quite
a long time and we hunted a good deal. Jack
used to come over and he and Father, and
sometimes the rest of us, would go trotting off
into the woods and stay for hours. Sometimes
Jack would see a pheasant or a grouse and get
awfully excited and run and run after it and
get so tired that when he came back he would
have to throw himself down and rest.
Usually, though, we never saw much except
chipmunks and squirrels; but one day Jack
found a rabbit in a clump of bushes and we all
had a merry time chasing him. Of course the
rest of us, with our short legs, couldn’t keep
up with Jack and he and the rabbit were soon
way ahead of us. And when we came up to
him he was sitting by a hole in the ground
where the rabbit had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>Freya and I began to dig at a great rate and
just made the dirt fly. Mother wanted to stop
us, but Father said “No, let them have their
fun.” Freya kept getting in my way, so I
had to nip her on the leg and chase her away.
Pretty soon all you could see of me was just
the tip of my tail sticking out of the hole.
And just then I heard a lot of barking and
when I had backed out all the others were
tearing across the field after that rabbit! He
had crept out of a hole on the other side of the
little hill where he lived and run off again. I
felt rather silly. The others came back pretty
soon without the rabbit. Mother said that
rabbits lived in houses with a great many
doors, and when you went in one door they
came out another. I don’t think that’s a fair
way to play, do you? Afterwards, though, I
was glad we hadn’t caught the rabbit, for he
was such a tiny, pretty little thing that it would
have been a shame to hurt him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>The weather got colder and colder and there
was more snow. We didn’t mind the cold,
though, for our coats had been growing thicker
and warmer since summer, and our house was
nice and cosy. One day Mother took Freya
and me down to the pond and when we got
there it looked very queer. I asked what had
happened to the water and she said it had
frozen into ice, and while I was looking at it
she gave me a push and I had to run down
the bank and when I got to the bottom and
came to the pond my feet went up in the air
and I went over on my back and I slid way
out on the ice. Mother and Freya stood there
and laughed at me, and when I tried to get on
my feet they just slipped from under me and
I was scared and whined. But Mother told
me not to be a baby and pretty soon I got back
to the shore and then I pushed Freya down
the bank and she slid, too, and made a worse
fuss about it than I had. Then Mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
showed us how we could walk quite nicely by
taking very short steps and soon we were all
three chasing each other about and falling
down and rolling over and having a grand
time.</p>

<p>One morning we awoke to find the snow
above the bottom of the Kennel windows, and
there was William out there with a red muffler
around his neck digging a path to us with a
wooden shovel. The snow that time was so
deep that we could only go where William had
made paths. But Father showed us how to
have a lot of fun by digging tunnels and Freya
and I dug one all the way from the Kennel to
the stable door. The funny thing was that in
the tunnels, under all that cold snow, it was
warmer than it was outside!</p>

<p>When William went to the village for the
mail and other things now he went in a sleigh,
and one afternoon he took all us dogs with him
and we had the finest sort of a time. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
barked at everything we saw, and once Freya
fell out of the sleigh into a snowbank and went
out of sight! (I pushed her off the seat, but
William didn’t know it.) In the village a
lady who kept the little store where William
bought his newspaper came out and petted us
and fed us peanuts. Peanuts are very nice.
The part you eat is inside a shell and you have
to crack the shell open first. Sometimes you
eat some of the shell too, without meaning to,
but it doesn’t hurt you. The lady thought it
was very funny to see us eat the peanuts and
she laughed a lot and said we were clever dogs.</p>

<p>“Sure, ma’am, they’ll eat anything at all,”
said William, and the lady laughed some more
and said:</p>

<p>“I know one thing they won’t eat.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked William.</p>

<p>So she went back into the little store and
came out with something that looked like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
lemon but wasn’t. “Let me see them eat
that,” she said to William.</p>

<p>“A pickled lime, is it?” said William.
“They’re that fond of ’em, ma’am, I can’t
keep enough of ’em on hand, but they’re bad
for dogs, ma’am.”</p>

<p>The lady laughed again. “That’s a fib,”
she said. “You know they wouldn’t touch it.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they then,” said William. “Just
watch ’em, ma’am.” So he took the pickled
lime and looked at us, trying to make up his
mind which of us to give it to. I hoped he
wouldn’t give it to me, but he did. “Eat it,
Fritzie,” he said coaxingly. “Good dog.”</p>

<p>Well, William was a friend of mine and I
wanted to help him out of his fix, and so I
took it and laid it down on the seat and ate it.
It was quite the worst tasting thing I ever had.
It was sort of sour and sort of salt and full of
puckery juice. But I ate it, and when it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
all gone I tried to make the lady think that
I wanted more, and William was so pleased
with me that afterwards he stopped at the
butcher’s and brought out a piece of meat for
each of us. I’m sure that meat saved me from
being a very sick dog. Even as it was I felt
quite unhappy for awhile and didn’t bark once
all the way home.</p>

<p>A few days after that the Family came back
and maybe I wasn’t glad to see them again.
William brought them from the station in the
big sleigh, and as soon as they were in the
house William called to us dogs and we all
went running in to see them. And the Master
said how well we all looked and how Freya
and I had grown, and the Baby sat down on
the floor and we all jumped about her and
licked her face and I ran off with one of her
fur mittens and took it under the couch and
chewed it a little. It was a very happy time.
William told the Master how I had eaten the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
pickled lime for him in the village and the
Master and Mistress laughed and laughed
about it and said I was a fine dog, and after
that for a long time the Master called me “the
limehound”!</p>

<p>It was wonderful the way the Baby had
grown in such a short time. I had to jump
now when I wanted to lick her face! She was
awfully glad to see us and cried a little when
William took us back to the Kennel.</p>

<small>HOW WE SPENT CHRISTMAS</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The next day the Master, the Mistress, the
Baby, William and us dogs went for a walk
together. William carried an axe and a piece
of rope. I thought we were going hunting.
The snow was quite deep and the Master and
the Mistress wore funny flat things under
their shoes which kept them from sinking
through the snow. The Master carried the
Baby in his arms until we had got to the woods,
and she kept saying “Kismas twee! Kismas
twee! Booful Kismas twee!” all the way.
When we were at the edge of the woods the
Master and William walked around and
looked at the trees and at last the Master said
“This one, William,” and William swung his
axe and down came the tree. It was only a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
small one and I tried to tell them that there
were very much larger ones further on, but
no one paid any attention to me. When the
tree was cut down William tied the rope to it
and we went home, William dragging the tree
after him over the snow. I thought it was a
pretty poor sort of hunt.</p>

<p>It began to snow again before we were back
at the house and William put us to bed early
that evening. The next morning the snow had
stopped and the sun was shining brightly.
William let us out and we all tore up to the
back door, very hungry indeed. And when
Cook gave us our breakfast what do you suppose
it was? What’s the nicest thing you can
think of? Mince pie? Why, of course not;
dogs don’t care for mince pie. No, nor candy—much.
What we had that morning was
liver and corn-bread, with lots of gravy! How
was that for a feast? And Cook and Delia
and William stood around and saw us eat it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and laughed and seemed very gay and happy.
And after that William took us into the
house.</p>

<p>There was the Baby and the Master and the
Mistress, and they all cried “Merry Christmas!”
as we came tumbling in; only the Baby
said “Maykismas!” instead, which was the
best she could do. Between the windows in
the big room was that tree we had brought
home the day before, but you would never
have known it for the same tree. I didn’t
know whether to bark at it or wag my tail. So
I growled. That tree was all covered with
the most wonderful sparkly things! There
were glass balls of red and yellow and green
and white and blue, and long strings of shiny
stuff that glittered in the sunlight, and
strings of pop-corn—only I’d never seen any
pop-corn just like it before, because it was
pink!—and all sorts of little toys and coloured
paper bags and, at the very tip-top of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
the tree, a little white angel with wings like
a dragon-fly! And underneath the tree were
many things wrapped in paper and tied with
red ribbons.</p>

<p>“Just see Freya!” laughed the Mistress.
Would you believe it, that dog had helped herself
to one of the packages and had taken it
under the table and was tearing the paper off
it! I was terribly ashamed of her, I can tell
you! But the Master and the Mistress didn’t
seem to mind it. They only laughed. And
the Master looked at what Freya had taken
and said: “Smart dog! It had her name on
it!” And the Baby clapped her hands and
every one seemed to think that Freya had
really done something very clever!</p>

<p>The Master reached under the tree then and
picked up one of the packages and looked at it
and said: “Now then, Young Fritz, here’s a
present for you. Sit up and ask for it, you
rascal!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>So I sat up on my hind legs and begged and
he put it in my mouth and I took it off to a
corner and smelled of it. It didn’t smell very
nice, I thought. It made me think of something
but I couldn’t remember what. So I
tore the paper off it and—can you guess what
I found? A pickled lime! Wasn’t that a
mean joke? I backed away from it in a hurry
and they all laughed at me and I crawled
under the couch where Freya was chewing on
a rubber ball with her eyes closed. I took it
away from her, but the Mistress said “No, no,
Fritzie! You mustn’t take Freya’s ball away.
Here’s something nice for you.”</p>

<p>So I sat up and begged again and the Master
gave me another present and when I’d got
the paper and ribbon off it there was a rubber
cat that squeaked every time I bit it! It
looked a little like Ju-Ju, who was sitting on
the window-sill with a new pink bow around
her neck, and when I saw that I bit it harder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>Father got a new collar and a rabbit made of
cloth, Mother got a Teddy bear and a tin bug
that walked across the floor and went <em>click-click-click</em>,
Freya got the ball and a cloth cat
which was bigger than mine but didn’t taste so
good and I got a wooden duck that flapped its
wings and opened its mouth when you moved
it. I didn’t think that the Family knew about
the time the duck made me fall into the brook,
but they must have. I suppose Ju-Ju told
them. That cat talks too much, anyway.</p>

<p>And we all had sweet biscuits and candy
which the Baby fed to us until the Mistress
told her we had had enough. After that we
were allowed to stay there and play a long
time. <a href="#i_105">I chewed that rubber cat until it stopped
squeaking and then tried the duck.</a> The paint
tasted very good. Freya stole a bag of candy
from the tree and ate half of it before I found
out about it and took it away from her.
Really, her manners were awful that day!</p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_103">I chewed that rubber cat until it stopped

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>I ate the rest of the candy so as to punish
her for stealing it, but I didn’t really want it
and after I had eaten it I began to feel sick.
It was just as well, I think, that they let us out
just then. I don’t know what the rest did, but
I hurried right down to the stable and got behind
the flower-pots and had quite a miserable
time of it for a while. You see, besides the
sweet biscuits and all that candy, I had eaten
most of a rubber cat and one wing of a wooden
duck. I think, though, that it was the yellow
paint that made me sick.</p>

<p>I felt better in the afternoon and crawled
out and went back to the house. The Baby
had a new sled and she was coasting down a
little hill behind the house. She would sit on
the sled and take one of us dogs in her arms
and then Nurse would give her a push and off
she would go. I coasted twice but didn’t care
much for it. I wasn’t feeling quite well yet.
For dinner that day we had turkey, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
fine; almost as good as liver and corn-bread.
I was very glad that I felt well enough by that
time to eat all that was given to me—and some
of Freya’s. Then William took us down and
put us to bed and that ended that Christmas
Day. I had had a very good time, on the
whole, but I was a little glad that Christmas
didn’t come very often!</p>

<small>MORE LESSONS</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was in February that Father and Mother
began going away from home for three and
four days at a time. William usually went
with them, but once the Master went. Each
time they came back they brought a bunch of
pretty ribbons, blue and red and yellow and
white, and William put them in a glass case in
the harness room where there were lots more.
Of course we asked Mother where the ribbons
came from and she said from the dog shows
and told us about them. But we didn’t understand
very well. It seemed that the ribbons
were prizes given to Father and Mother because
they were such fine dogs, and William
and the Master and every one was very pleased
and proud each time Father and Mother came
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>Father was proud, too. He got more ribbons
than Mother. I didn’t think that was
fair, but Mother didn’t seem to mind. After
each show Father would be very lazy and just
lie around and look proud and Mother would
fetch him bones. But after a day or two
Father would forget to be proud and find his
own bones. It wasn’t much fun for Freya
and I when Father was being proud, because
he slept a lot and if we made the least noise
Mother would say “Hush, children! Your
father is taking a nap and you mustn’t waken
him. Go somewhere else and play.” So we
were glad when the dog shows stopped for a
while.</p>

<p>Freya and I were to learn about dog shows
for ourselves, though. When we were almost
a year old William began putting a leash on
my collar and Freya’s and walking us about.
At first I didn’t like it at all. It made me
quite nervous to have that strap holding me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
back. The first time William put it on I stood
still and he kept tugging at it and saying
“Come on, now, Fritzie! Come on now!” I
was quite willing to go with him, but I didn’t
like the feeling of that collar up around my
ears. Still, it didn’t do any good to put my
feet out and hold back because William
dragged me, and when I found that out I decided
I’d run away from him. So I started
off in a hurry. But there was that horrid
strap, and when I’d gone a little ways my feet
went out from under me and I turned a somersault.
That frightened me and I ran off in
another direction. But each time that leash
stopped me. Then I began to run around
William in circles and howl and presently,
when I couldn’t run any more, because the
leash was wrapped around William’s legs, I
gave a final tug and William fell over on his
back in a flower-bed where there were some
sweet peas just coming up. He was very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
angry. I saw that at once and so I tried my
best to get away from there. But the more I
tried to run the angrier William got. You
see, he couldn’t get the strap from around his
legs and so he couldn’t get on his feet. And
just then I heard the Baby clapping her hands
and Nurse saying “Why, William! Whatever
are you doing there?”</p>

<p>And then William was so surprised and felt
so silly that he let go the leash and I pulled it
loose and ran as hard as I could run to the
stable and crawled behind the flower-pots.
But of course he found me and pulled me out.
He always did. Sometimes now I wonder
why I didn’t find a better place to hide in.</p>

<p>Well, William had his way in the end and I
got so I didn’t mind being on the leash and
would walk along ahead of him quite nicely.
Freya had to learn too. She didn’t mind it as
much as I had, but then she never had much
spirit. After we got used to the leash William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
would put a flat box in the middle of the
carriage room floor and make us get up on it
and stand there for minutes at a time. I
didn’t see much fun in that, and at first when
he got me on the box I jumped right down
again. But he was very—very—Now what
was it that Mother said he was? Oh, patient;
that was it; very patient. That was what
Mother called it, but I said he was stubborn.</p>

<p>Anyway, he kept at me until I did just what
he wanted me to, and after a while I didn’t
mind standing on the box, although I couldn’t
see much sense in it and it seemed a dreadful
waste of time. But Mother told us what it
was all for, and then I was quite willing to do
what William wanted. You see, we were being
trained for the dog shows. I thought that
was very nice because it meant going on a journey,
just as Father and Mother had, and bringing
back a lot of pretty ribbons. Father said,
though, that if I didn’t behave better than I’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
been behaving I wouldn’t get any ribbons.
Father can be quite gruff at times. Freya was
so excited about it that she could talk of nothing
else.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be fine,” she would say, “to be in
a show and have hundreds of people admiring
you and patting you and saying what a lovely
dog you are? I know I shall just love it,
Fritz!”</p>

<p>Girl-dogs are always vain, you see. Vanity
is not becoming in dogs any more than in Two-Legged
Folks and so I growled and said: “I
guess no one will look twice at you, Miss
Stuck-Up! You’re much too homely.”</p>

<p>That made Freya cry and she ran off to ask
her mother if it was so. Of course she really
wasn’t homely. I only said that so she
wouldn’t be vain and proud. Freya in some
ways was a better looking dog than I was.
Her coat was what the Master called “perfectly
wonderful.” It was very black and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
very shiny; just like satin. And her ears were
fine and long and silky. And she had nice
eyes, too, and a good tail. My tail had a place
on the tip where there was no hair. Poor William
troubled a lot about that spot and rubbed
it with grease for weeks and weeks. The
grease didn’t seem to do much good, though.
Perhaps I licked it off too soon. That place
never has got quite right and I don’t think it
ever will. But even if Freya was a little better
looking than I, she couldn’t run as fast or
dig as deep or do useful things as well as I
could. I was lots stronger and bigger.
Mother said that was as it should be; that girl-dogs
were not supposed to be as big and brave
and strong as boy-dogs.</p>

<p>Well, William taught us all sorts of things
that Spring. It was a good deal of a bother,
but the thought of being taken to the dog show
helped me to be patient and go through with it.
After we had been in training for a month or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
more I asked Mother when the show was to
be and she said she didn’t know; that maybe it
wouldn’t come for a long time. I didn’t like
that and I had made up my mind that there
wasn’t any use in going through with so many
lessons if nothing was to come of it when, one
morning, the Master came down to the stable.</p>

<p>“Well, how are they getting on, William?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Fair, sir,” said William. “Freya takes to
it like the lady she is, sir, but Young Fritz is
slower. He’s as stubborn as his father, sir.”</p>

<p>Now I thought that very unkind of William
after all the trouble I had taken to please him,
and just to show that my feelings were hurt I
sneaked off and got behind the flower-pots.
But I could hear what they were saying in the
carriage room, and pretty soon the Master
said:</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ll try them out at the Oak
Cliff Show in June. It’s nearby and there’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
only one day of it. They’re bound to be nervous
the first time and a small show is a good
one to start them with.”</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at that, because it was
already the last of May, and crawled out from
back of the flower-pots.</p>

<small>A VISIT TO JACK</small></h3>
</div>


<p>“Freya won’t mind it a bit, sir,” William was
saying. “She’s the sort that loves a bit of fuss
and excitement. She’ll show well, she will,
sir.”</p>

<p>William always thought whatever Freya did
was all right. I made up my mind to show
them that I could behave just as well as she
could, and so I went back to the carriage room.</p>

<p>“Well, let me see how they act,” said the
Master.</p>

<p>So William snapped the leash on my collar
and walked me slowly around in a circle several
times. Then he stopped and I stopped
and stood quite still. Then he led me to the
box and said “Up, boy!” and I jumped up on
the box and stood there very straight, with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
head up and my body stretched as long as I
could stretch it. Then William took hold of
my tail and lifted my back legs up by it, and
felt me all over and opened my mouth and
looked at my teeth and went through with all
the things he always did when I was on the
box. And finally he said “All right, boy!”
and I jumped down and looked at the Master
and wagged my tail. I could see at once that
he was very pleased.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s nothing wrong with him, William!”
said the Master. “I never saw a dog
have any better ring manners than that.”</p>

<p>William scratched his head and shook it and
looked at me in a puzzled way. “Well, sir,”
he said at last, “I never knew him to do it like
that before. Seems as if he was sort of showing
off, don’t it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” laughed the Master, “and that’s
what we want him to do!”</p>

<p>Then Freya went through with it and didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
do as well as I had because she kept wiggling
all the time, wanting the Master to speak to
her and pet her. Girl-dogs are silly that way.
There’s a time for everything, but they don’t
understand it. They always want to play
when it’s time to work, which is quite wrong.
Well, the Master was much pleased with both
of us and said that we’d surely be shown at the
Oak Cliff Show next month, and that he’d
send in the entries at once. I ran off to tell
Mother about it and she was pleased too.</p>

<p>“You must be a very good dog,” she said,
“and do just as William tells you to. And
when you get to the show you must mind your
own affairs and pay no attention to other dogs
or to people. I don’t think your father or I
will be there, so you must look after yourself
and Freya.”</p>

<p>I was sorry Father and Mother were not
going, but I was quite excited at the thought of
Freya and I going alone, and I hunted up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Freya to tell her. When I found her she was
looking very sad and I asked her what the
matter was.</p>

<p>“I have a pimple,” she whined. “William
just found it. He says if I don’t get rid of it
before the show I won’t get a prize.”</p>

<p>And she absolutely began to cry! Aren’t
girl-dogs funny? I looked at the pimple and
it was so small I couldn’t see it at first. It
wasn’t worth bothering about. I’d had them
five times as large as hers. Why, the time I
ate the crow that I found in the truck garden
I had dozens of great huge ones! And William
put some smelly stuff on them and gave
me a dose of nasty medicine and they went
right away again. So I laughed at Freya and
she stopped crying, and after William had
rubbed something on the pimple I told her
what Mother had said. I thought she would
be quite pleased about it, but she wasn’t. You
never can tell what a girl-dog will do!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Freya, “I should be frightened to
death to go away without Father and Mother!
I just couldn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “you’ll just have to. Besides,
William will be there and maybe the
Master, too.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t the same as having your own
parents,” said Freya, looking teary again.
“Suppose—suppose anything happened to us!”</p>

<p>“What could happen?” I asked. “Besides,
<em>I’m</em> going to be there!”</p>

<p>That ought to have satisfied her, I thought,
but it didn’t, and she went running off to tell
Mother how frightened she was. That was
too much for me and I trotted over to call on
Jack and tell him the news.</p>

<p>I found him in the back yard eating a fine
big veal bone. “Hello, Fritz,” he said, pushing
the bone to me. “Want to chew on that?
It isn’t half bad. I’m afraid I’ve eaten the
best of it, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>It was very nice and sweet, that bone, and I
settled down to enjoy it, and between crunches
I told him about Freya and I going alone to
the dog show. He didn’t seem to think it was
so grand, though. He kind of turned up his
lip at it.</p>

<p>“The Oak Cliff Show?” he said. “Oh,
that’s just a small affair, a one-day show,
managed by the women folks. It’s pretty
good fun, of course, but even if you do bring
back some ribbons they don’t amount to much.”</p>

<p>I guess he saw that I was disappointed, because
he went on: “Not that it isn’t worth
while, of course. I used to go to it when I was
a little fellow. You’ll like it and I dare say
Freya will get a ‘blue.’ You too, maybe. A
‘red,’ anyhow. I have five or six ‘blues’ that
I got there.” He yawned. “When is it to
be?”</p>

<p>“Some time in June,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Of course; it always is in June. I meant
what day?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell him that, though.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have a good time. Don’t let
folks handle you too much, Fritz. It upsets
you and you don’t do so well in the ring. And
don’t pay any attention to the judges. Act as
if you didn’t see them. When I was a puppy
I was too friendly and bit one of the judges on
the nose when he was bending over me. I
just did it in play, but I guess I bit too hard,
because he made a great to-do about it and sent
me right out of the ring and I didn’t even get
a mention.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” I said, “a great many dogs go
to it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about a hundred, I think. You’ll meet
all kinds. Don’t have much to do with them.
Some of them are no-account dogs. It takes
all sorts of dogs to make a world, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“A hundred!” I said. “My, but that’s a lot
of dogs, isn’t it? I didn’t know there were so
many in the world, Jack!”</p>

<p>Jack laughed. “A hundred’s nothing,” he
said. “In the New York show I’ve seen nearly
five hundred! That’s a show that is a show,
Fritz! Maybe if you do pretty well at Oak
Cliff the Master will send you there next winter.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would,” I answered. “It must
be fine.”</p>

<p>Jack yawned again. “It’s rather good fun
until you get used to it,” he said. “Going?
Well, come again. I’ll drop over and see you
before the show.”</p>

<p>So I thanked him for the loan of his bone
and trotted home.</p>

<small>THE TURTLE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>A week before we were to go to Oak Cliff
William began to groom us every morning and
evening. We were rubbed all over with a
cloth that was wet with something that smelled
good and left our coats smooth and glossy.
We were brushed, too, and our claws were cut
and our teeth were cleaned and he even washed
our ears! I stood everything very well but
that. I do hate to have my ears washed.
Don’t you?</p>

<p>As for that bare spot on the end of my tail,
poor William worked and worked and fussed
and fussed and worried and worried over that.
“I’m thinking,” he told me once, “that it would
be fine if you’d wag your tail hard when the
judge is looking at you and maybe he won’t
see where the hair’s off!” I suspected that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
William put some sort of medicine in our food
those days. I couldn’t find it, but there was
a little different taste to things. I think that
is a very mean thing to do to a dog. Poor
Freya had a hard time getting enough to eat
that week, because William said she was a little
too fat and so he only gave her about half what
he usually did. Sometimes, if I wasn’t awfully
hungry and William wasn’t looking, I’d
leave a little in my dish and let her finish it.</p>

<p>Of course all the attention we had took a lot
of time and it was hard to stay quiet so long.
But I went through with it as best I could because
I knew that the nicer I looked at the
show the more likely I was to get a pretty ribbon.
The worst of it was that after William
had groomed us we were supposed to be very
good and keep ourselves clean. That wasn’t
much trouble for Freya. She liked being
fussed over and I think she was glad of an excuse
to be lazy and lie around in the sun and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
not go hunting. But it wasn’t so easy for me,
and try as hard as I might I seemed to be always
getting into scrapes. Like the time I
caught the turtle.</p>

<p>William had just fixed me all up until I felt
much too clean for comfort and told me to be
good and not get dirty. I really meant to
obey him, but I didn’t think it was much fun
to just lie around the stable and so I asked
Freya to go for a run with me. She wouldn’t,
though. She said William wouldn’t like it
if she did. So I went off alone and wandered
down into the meadow and chased grasshoppers
for awhile. There isn’t much fun in that,
though. They’re not good to eat when you
catch them. So I went on down to the brook
and presently I saw the funniest looking thing
you can imagine. When I told Mother about
it afterwards she said it was a turtle, but I
didn’t know what it was then because <a href="#i_124fp">I had
never seen one before</a>. It lived in a shell that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
was a sort of greenish-brown on top and yellow
underneath. There were two funny little
paws on each side and a funny little tail behind
and a much funnier little head in front, and it
was crawling along very slowly toward the
brook. I watched it a minute and then I ran
up to it and barked. Then it did the queerest
thing! Instead of barking back or saying
“quack” like the ducks or “cluck” like the hens
it just pulled itself inside that shell until there
wasn’t anything in sight but the place it lived!</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_124fp">
  <img src="images/i_124fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_126">I had never seen one before</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I thought that was very impolite and so I
turned it over with my nose and barked again.
But it wouldn’t come out. I barked at it a
long time but it did no good, and then I lay
down a little ways off and watched. Pretty
soon the turtle thought I’d gone away and out
came his head very, very slowly and he looked
around with two little glittering yellow eyes.
I think he was quite surprised to find himself
on his back. He looked surprised, anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and he worked his paws and tried to turn himself
over. Then he saw me, I guess, for he
went back into his house very quickly again.</p>

<p>“You are a very stupid fellow,” I said,
“whatever you are. Come on out and play.”</p>

<p>But he wouldn’t, and so pretty soon I went
over to him and patted him with my paw.
That didn’t bring him out, either. I made up
my mind then that I’d take him home to
Mother and ask her what he was. So I just
picked him up in my mouth, house and all, and
started along the brook with him. I had gone
just a little ways when I felt a sharp pain in
my lip, and I looked and that turtle had put
his head out and was biting me! You may
believe that I let go of him pretty quick! But
he wouldn’t let go of me. He hung right on
to my lip and swung there. I pawed at him
and rubbed my head on the ground and howled,
but it did no good. That turtle held on tight.
By that time he was hurting a lot and I began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
to yelp and roll around and shake my head and
do everything I could think of to get rid of
him. And in the middle of it I slipped over
the side of the bank and rolled down into the
brook on my back!</p>

<p>After that I don’t remember just what did
happen for a minute or two. I know that the
turtle was still there and that I stuck my head
into the mud and rolled over and over in the
water and had an awful time and almost
drowned myself before that horrid turtle finally
let go of me. When I crawled out I was covered
with mud and water and my lip was bleeding
and I was shaking all over. I laid down
for a while on the bank to get my breath and
then I went back to the stable, hoping I could
get behind the flower-pots before William saw
me. But I didn’t. He was washing a carriage,
and Father was helping him, when I got
there, and he saw me before I could get by.
My, but he was angry! He just took hold of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
me by the neck and held me with one hand and
turned the hose on me with the other. Being
washed with a hose is very unpleasant. The
water gets in your eyes and mouth and ears.
I had a very bad time of it. William scolded
and scolded until he saw the place on my lip
where the turtle had bitten me. Then he was
sorry for me and dried me with a big chamois-skin
and put some salve on the wound and it
felt better. And I crawled behind the flower-pots
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Turtles and toads and ducks and bees are
not good for dogs. They don’t play fair.
It’s funny the lot of trouble I got into down
by that brook. There was the time the duck
“quacked” at me and I fell into the mud and
the time the toad poisoned my mouth and the
time the turtle bit me. You would think that
I’d have learned to stay away from the brook,
but I never did.</p>

<small><a href="#i_142">AT THE DOG SHOW</a></small></h3>
</div>


<p>We started out, William and Freya and I,
very early one morning for the dog show. I
think it was a Saturday. Anyhow, I remember
that we had liver for breakfast the next
day, and we usually had liver on Sundays.
Freya and I were put in the dog crate and the
crate was put in the little wagon and William
drove. The Master, the Mistress and the
Baby went in the carriage. Father and
Mother were left at home. Father made quite
a fuss about it and climbed into the wagon
twice and had to be put out, but Mother just
told us to be good children and not get into
trouble and went back and laid down in the
stable doorway.</p>

<p>Freya was so excited that she couldn’t keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
still. I was excited, too, but I didn’t show it.
I just laid down on the bottom of the crate
and peeked out between the slats and tried to
see the world. It was hard work, though, because
the slats were very close together and
the wagon bumped a good deal. After a while
the wagon slowed down and we heard a lot of
barking and knew that we were almost there.
When William lifted the crate down and
opened it the Master looked in and said
“Hello, you rascals! Have a good trip?”
Freya and I licked his hand and he put chains
on our collars and we jumped out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_142">
  <img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_130">At the dog show</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I was a little frightened at first. Never had
I seen so many people or heard so many dogs.
And as for carriages and automobiles, why, I
suppose there must have been hundreds!
Folks were walking around over the grass and
dogs were being taken out of hampers and
crates and it was a strange and wonderful
scene. In front of us was a monstrous big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
tent, oh, quite the largest tent you can possibly
imagine! And from the tent came such a
barking and yelping as I’d never heard.
Freya tugged at her chain and seemed very
anxious to get to it, but I held back and sort
of wished myself back home. But just then
the Mistress and the Baby came up with some
other folks, and the Baby put her arms around
my neck and said I was her “booful dogums”
and I felt braver. So we all went into the
tent.</p>

<p>It was full of platforms, or “benches” as
they called them, which were open in front and
closed at back and divided into little pens by
wire screens. William led us to one of the
pens and as we went all the dogs who saw us
barked and yelped and said things to us and
made a frightful noise. We jumped up on
the bench and William tied our chains to rings
in the back of the pen. There were two pieces
of paper with numbers on them tacked there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and the Master tied tags to our collars, and
the tags had the same numbers that were on
the back of the pen. Mine was 86 and
Freya’s was 87. William brought a big armful
of nice clean straw and put it on the bottom
of the pen and I got as far away into a corner
as I could and laid down and shivered a little.
But Freya jumped and tugged at her chain
and barked and went on very rudely. William
took a piece of cloth and rubbed us hard
with it and then he brought us some water.</p>

<p>While I was lying in the corner a dog in the
next pen tried to put his nose through the grating
and I turned around quickly and nipped it.
It didn’t hurt him much, I guess, but he made
an awful fuss about it and a lady who was sitting
on the edge of his pen scolded me and
said I was a horrid dog and that if I did that
again she’d have me taken away. She took
that other dog in her arms and petted him and
gave him something to eat out of a little bag,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and the dog whined and sniffled and acted terribly
silly. I made up my mind that if he put
his nose into our pen again I’d give him another
nip. And just then he saw me looking
over at him and he winked at me, and I knew
that he had been making all that fuss so his
Mistress would give him something out of the
little bag!</p>

<p>I asked him later on what it was she gave
him and he said it was raw meat. He said I
didn’t hurt him much but he wanted the meat.
He was the same kind of a dog as I, only he
was all brown and very fat. We got to be
very good friends later. His name was Sigismund.
He told me that his Mistress took him
to all the shows but he never got a prize but
once and then there were only two other dachshunds
there. He said he didn’t mind not getting
prizes, but that his Mistress always felt
very badly about it and was quite cross to the
judges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“She thinks I’m a very fine dog,” he said,
“but I’m not, you know. You can see yourself
that I’m too short in the body and too high
at the back. Besides, my teeth are bad. That
comes from too much meat. It’s all rather
tiresome, this sort of thing, but she likes it and
I put up with it. Who is the dog with you?”</p>

<p>I told him she was my sister and he said she
was very pretty and he guessed she’d get a blue
ribbon. All this was later in the day, though,
after I’d got sort of used to the noise and all
the people. They kept walking around and
walking around until it made my head spin to
see them. I did wish they’d sit down somewhere
or go away. They’d stop in front of us
and say the rudest things! Why, one lady
looked at us and said “Did you ever see such
funny things, Tom? The idea of any one
thinking them nice!” Freya let folks pat her
but I didn’t. I growled.</p>

<p>Across the aisle from us were a lot of big,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
long-haired dogs with pointed noses. I heard
William say they were collies. They did nothing
but bark all the time. They were the most
excited dogs I ever saw. Further along were
some fox terriers, and besides those there were
all kinds of other dogs whose names I didn’t
know.</p>

<p>All the time dogs were going by on chains,
and Sigismund said they were going to the
judging pen. I couldn’t see the judging pen
but I could hear people clapping their hands,
and every little while a dog would pass us with
a blue or a red or a yellow ribbon on his collar
which the judges had given him. And if it
was a blue ribbon he would look very, very
proud, and if it was another coloured ribbon
he looked just a little bit proud. I asked
Sigismund if it was very hard being judged
and he said it wasn’t and that he usually took
a nap while it was going on.</p>

<p>It got very warm in the tent after a while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and William gave us some fresh water and a
piece of biscuit, which was all we had for dinner.
Pretty soon after that a man in overalls
went around saying: “Class 49, Dachshunds!
All entries to the judging pen!” Then William
made us jump down and he and the Master
led us to where there was a square pen
fenced off with boards. All around it on the
outside were people looking over the top of
the fence. Inside there were many dachshunds
when we got there and more followed us
through the gate. Sigismund was there, too,
with his mistress. He winked at me and then
closed his eyes and looked exactly as if he was
going to sleep!</p>

<p>Presently we all began to walk around in a
circle at the end of our chains while two men
stood in the centre of the pen and watched us.
Then we stopped walking and the two men
came and looked us all over, and one by one
we stood on a little platform in the centre and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the two judges felt of us and pulled us and
looked into our mouths and made me very
nervous. But when my time came I remembered
what William had taught me and what
Mother had said and stood very quiet and held
my head up and stretched my legs out. It
really wasn’t bad at all because the man who
judged me was very gentle and I didn’t mind
what he did.</p>

<p>After me three other dogs went on the box
and were judged. And then the two judges
talked together a minute and went over to a
little table in one corner and picked up some
ribbons and came back. I wondered whether
they would give one of them to William, and
they did, but it was a red ribbon and William
didn’t look very pleased even if he did say
“Thank you” quite nicely. A very handsome
dog named Champion Hillside Carl got the
blue ribbon, which was the first prize. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
sorry I had got only the second prize because
William looked so disappointed.</p>

<p>Then it was Freya’s turn to try and she and
five other girl-dogs were put on the box one
after the other, and Freya looked so pretty that
the people watching over the fence clapped
their hands. That pleased Freya and she
wagged her tail and smiled at the judge and he
patted her head. And when it was all over the
judge walked right up to the Master and gave
him the blue ribbon, and every one clapped
some more and all the dogs barked. William
didn’t feel so badly after Freya had got the
first prize.</p>

<p>I thought then that we would be led back
to our bench, but it seemed that we were to try
for other prizes first. There were prizes for
what they called “novices,” which were dogs
who had never been in a show before. There
was a prize for boy novices and one for girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
novices, and Freya and I each won a first, and
by that time William was all smiles. Then
Freya and I were judged as a pair and we
each got a second prize. The first prize went
to Champion Hillside Carl and a girl-dog who
was quite good-looking but not nearly so
pretty as Freya.</p>

<p>Then we went back to the bench and William
and the Master said how well we had
done and how nicely we had behaved in the
pen. Besides the lovely ribbons, which had
gold letters on them and which William at
once hung up at the back of the bench, we had
won money. Freya had won eleven dollars
and I had won nine. The Master said we
should each have a fine new collar. I wanted
to wear my ribbons, but William wouldn’t let
me. Sigismund had not won anything at all
and I was very sorry for him, and told him so.
But he only laughed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect to,” he said. “I never do.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
For my part I’d much rather stay at home, but
my Mistress likes this sort of thing. She told
the judges that they didn’t know their business.
She always tells them that. You did
very well, you and your sister both. You’d
have got that other blue if that Hillside Carl
dog hadn’t been there. He’s been winning
first prizes for two years now. I meet him
everywhere I go. He’s an awfully stuck-up
chap.” He yawned and stretched himself.
“Well, it’s about over now and I shall be glad
to get home again.”</p>

<p>I curled up and took a little nap and when
I awoke William was taking the ribbons down
and it was time to go home. We jumped back
in the crate and pretty soon we were bumping
along the road once more. Freya was still too
excited to keep still, but I managed to get a
few more winks of sleep on the way back.
When we reached the stable Father and
Mother were waiting for us and maybe they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
weren’t pleased when we told them about the
prizes! Mother jumped around and licked
our faces and barked. Father didn’t say
much, but I could see that he was every bit as
glad as Mother. When I told him about
Champion Hillside Carl he sort of growled.</p>

<p>“Humph,” he said, “was that dog there to-day?
I’ve beaten Carl twice and I could have
done it again. He isn’t so fine. His ears are
too short, and he is deaf in the left one. Only
the judges are too stupid to find it out! I
wish <em>I’d</em> been there!”</p>

<p>We had a supper of broth and bread and
went to sleep early, being pretty well tired out.</p>

<small>THE STRANGE MAN</small></h3>
</div>


<p>There were no more dog shows for us that
summer, although Father and Mother went to
one in August and Father came back with
three blue ribbons and Mother with a blue and
two reds. Father had beaten Champion Hillside
Carl quite easily and was very proud for
several days and Mother trotted her feet off
finding bones for him.</p>

<p>It was just after the show that Alfred and
his mother came to visit us again, and I was
awfully glad to see him. He had grown a
good deal since the summer before. But then
I had grown too and he said he would scarcely
have known me! I don’t know which of us
was gladder to see him, the Baby or I. We
had some fine times in the next two weeks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
We hunted squirrels in the orchard and had
picnics in the woods and played all sorts of
games. But we didn’t look for Indians in the
swamp, I can tell you!</p>

<p><a href="#i_146fp">Alfred</a> liked me best of all the dogs and one
evening he came down to the Kennel after it
was dark and carried me to the house and <a href="#i_146fp">took
me to bed with him</a> and I slept there all night
curled up in his arms. In the morning we had
a fine romp when we woke up, but I guess we
must have made too much noise, for Nurse
heard us and came in and said, “Why, Master
Alfred, wherever did you get that dog? Put
him right off the bed this very instant!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_146fp">
  <img src="images/i_146fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_144">Alfred took me to bed with him</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Nurse had left the door open and so I ran
out as hard as I could and down the stairs.
It wasn’t my fault that Delia was coming up
just then with a tray of toast and coffee for
Alfred’s mother, was it? Besides, she might
have seen me if she had been looking. She
didn’t, though, and I was in a great hurry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
tried to run between her feet. I was almost
at the bottom of the stairs when I heard the
tray fall, and a piece of toast came rolling
down after me. I thought it best not to stop
for it, however, although I am very fond of
buttered toast. Fortunately, William was
shining the brass knocker on the front door and
I was able to get out without more trouble.</p>

<p>I went right down to the stable and got behind
the flower-pots and stayed there until the
middle of the forenoon, but nothing happened,
and so, when I heard Alfred whistling, I came
out. William was there, too, and when I saw
him I laid down on my back and put my feet
up. But he only laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be letting Delia get hold of you to-day,”
he said. “Keep away from the kitchen,
Fritzie, my boy.”</p>

<p>And then he and Alfred both looked at each
other and laughed again, and Alfred and I
found the Baby and Freya and went down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
the brook and waded. When I saw Delia she
had a piece of white cloth tied around her head.
I don’t know why she did it, because it didn’t
make her look any prettier.</p>

<p>After that Alfred took me to bed with him
several times and I liked it a lot. And Nurse
didn’t say a thing when she found me there.
Delia and I made it up and were good friends
again in a day or two. And then it came time
for Alfred to go back to the city and I felt
very sad and lonesome. So did the Baby, and
she and I used to sit together in the hammock
on the piazza and talk about Alfred and wish
him back again. I was a great comfort to the
Baby, I’m sure.</p>

<p>I was a year and a half old that Autumn,
which, for a dog, is quite grown-up, you know.
When I did anything silly Mother would say:
“Remember, Fritz, you are no longer a
puppy.” It was hard to do that, though, and
I was just as fond of play as ever. But, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
course, I had grown much more sensible and
wise. Experience is a great teacher. I heard
Father say that once, and I guess it must be
so. I didn’t get into scrapes any more; at
least, not many. I did dig a hole under the
stable one day and then couldn’t get out again
until William had taken some of the stones out
of the wall. But that was because I didn’t
know that the ground under the stable was so
much lower than it was outside. It was rather
a jolly place down there and I think there
were rats there, but I was too frightened when
I found I couldn’t get out again to do any
hunting. And after that William put a stone
where I’d gone in and I was never able to get
back to make sure.</p>

<p>And then there was another scrape, too,
which was quite the worst I ever got into. I
shall not forget that very soon, I can tell you!
It happened that October and this was the way
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>Freya cared less for hunting and running
around than ever that Fall and so I used to
go about a good deal alone. Sometimes
Father would take me to look for foxes, but
that wasn’t very often, and we never found
any. And sometimes Jack and I would go for
a run together. It wasn’t much fun for him,
though, because my legs were so short that he
had to wait for me to catch up to him every
little while. So very often I went alone. I
didn’t mind. There is so much to see if you
use your eyes and so much to smell if you use
your nose. And there are lots of nice things
to listen to, besides. Like the songs that the
birds sing and the whispers the breezes make in
the trees and the chattering of the squirrels
and chipmunks and so many, many other
sounds. There are lots of wonderful and interesting
things in the world, and a dog who is
treated kindly and has a nice home to live in
has a very good time. The nice home has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
lot to do with a dog’s happiness, as I found out
when I didn’t have one.</p>

<p>One nice sunny day, when the leaves on the
trees were all yellow and red and were fluttering
down, I found myself on the road that
passes our gate. I had been chasing a chipmunk.
He ran along on top of the wall and
the fence, making a funny little squeaky noise,
and every time I got near him he would give
a long jump and get away again. And sometimes
he would run down to the ground and
hide and I’d have to hunt him out. When I
lost him finally in a hole that went down under
the stone wall I was nearly half a mile from
home and there was a man walking toward me
along the road.</p>

<p>He didn’t look quite like a nice man and I
started to trot away from him. But he called
to me in a kind voice and so I stopped and
looked back. And when I looked he stooped
and held something toward me in his hand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
it had a very good smell. William doesn’t
give us raw meat except once in a great while
when we aren’t feeling very well, but I knew
the smell of it and I knew that it was raw meat
that the man wanted to give me. I was hungry
and so I thought it over and decided that
if he really didn’t want the meat himself I
might as well have it.</p>

<p>But I was a little bit afraid and didn’t go
right up to him. He tossed a piece toward me
and I went back and got it and it surely tasted
awfully nice. Then he tossed me another piece
and I ate that, and almost before I knew it I
was eating the rest of the meat out of his
hand and he was patting me and saying “Good
dog.” And then he slipped a piece of string
through the new collar that the Master had
bought me with the money I had won at the
dog show and when I tried to turn around and
go home he wouldn’t let me! Instead of that
he pulled me down the road right in the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
direction. At first I went along without
any fuss, but when we got farther and farther
away I began to pull back and whine. Then
he got very angry with me and when he saw
I would not go unless he pulled me he called
me names and kicked me!</p>

<p>I had never been kicked before and it
frightened me even more than it hurt, and it
hurt a good deal. I yelped and tried to run
away then, but the string held me, and every
time I sat down and wouldn’t walk he kicked
me with his boot. I soon saw that if I didn’t
want to be kicked I must go with him, and so
I went. But I was awfully frightened and I
wanted to bite him but didn’t dare to. Pretty
soon we came to a cross road which was winding
and narrow and we turned into that and
walked and walked for the longest way before
we came to a house. It was a very small house
and it needed paint and the yard in front was
dirty and untidy. And when we went through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the gate a horrid ugly big bulldog came running
toward us, barking and growling. But
the man kicked him too, and the bulldog
howled and ran into a shed near the house.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_2VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>HOW I WAS STOLEN</small></h3>
</div>


<p>The man took me into the house, which was
just as dirty and untidy as the yard and smelt
badly, and tied the string to the leg of a table
there. He went into another room for a few
minutes and I sat there and shivered until he
came back. Then he took off my nice new collar,
with its silver name-plate and silver buckle,
and slipped a horrid old leather strap around
my neck. He read what it said on the name-plate
and then tossed the collar aside.</p>

<p>“You ought to fetch a good price, old boy,
if they give you a collar like that,” he said.
“Come on now.”</p>

<p>So he led me outdoors again and across to
the shed where the bulldog was. When the
bulldog saw the man come in he howled and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
ran out quickly. There were some boxes in
one corner of the shed that had bars in front
of them and I was put into one of these. Then
the man went out and closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>It was quite dark in there, and cold and
damp too, and there was nothing in the box
to lie on, and I was very unhappy. I sat and
shivered and whimpered for a long time, and it
got darker and darker. No one came to see
me. I heard the bulldog prowling about outside
and sniffing at the door and I heard the
man whistle to him once. Then it got quite
dark and after a while I cried myself to sleep.
But I was too cold to sleep soundly and I was
very glad when the light began to come back
and I knew that it was morning again.</p>

<p>The man brought me two or three bones
without much meat on them and a broken dish
with some water in it. I didn’t care much for
the bones, but wanted the water a good deal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
The man left the door open a little when he
went out and pretty soon the bulldog came
sneaking in.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said gruffly, “and where’d he pick
you up?”</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>“So you’re one of those pet dogs I’ve heard
of,” he sneered. “Lie on a cushion and eat
cake, they tell me. Well, you won’t get any
cake here. Bones and kicks are all you’ll have
now for a while. I know. I’ve lived here
four years. Pass out one of those bones.
They’re mine by rights, anyway.”</p>

<p>I told him he could have them all and pushed
them through the bars where he could get
them, and he seemed more good-natured after
that. He ate them just as though he was half-starved,
and growled and growled over them.
He had very bad table manners. After he
had chewed them until there was nothing left
on them he laid down and we talked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>He wasn’t really a bad sort of dog at heart,
only he had been treated cruelly all his life,
kicked and beaten and half-starved. Dogs,
you know, are very much like you Two-Legged
Folks. Be gentle and kind to us and we will
be gentle and kind, too. Treat us crossly and
we may grow to be cross and snappy like you.
You are the ones we serve, and so it is not
strange that we should learn our manners from
you. Poor <a href="#i_161">Jim</a>—for that was the bulldog’s
name—had had only blows and ugly words
ever since he was a puppy and he didn’t know
what it was to be well-fed and petted and
looked after. He had heard of dogs who had
nice homes and kind masters and he pretended
to make fun of them and called them “pets,”
but I knew very well that he envied them all
the time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_161">
  <img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_156">“Jim”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I asked him what his master would do with
me and why he had taken me from my home,
and he said that I would be taken to the City<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and sold. “You’re not the first dog who has
been here,” he said. “Every month or so he
brings one home with him. I’ve met a lot of
them in my time.”</p>

<p>“But he has no right to do that,” I said.
“If I did a thing like that William would say
I was stealing.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Jim. “He’s a thief. He
makes his living by it. He will get twenty or
thirty dollars for you, perhaps. He would
have sold me long ago if I had been worth selling.
Besides, he needs me here to keep people
away.”</p>

<p>“Did—did he steal you, too?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose so. I’ve been
here ever since I can remember. Probably he
stole me when I was a very little puppy.
Sometimes I’ve thought I’d run away, but I
never have. I’m afraid to. I’m such an ugly
looking dog that no one would want me, I
guess. So I just stay here and take what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
comes. I wouldn’t mind what he did if he
would only give me a kind word once in a
while.”</p>

<p>Just then there was a noise outside and Jim
sprang up with a growl and went to the door.</p>

<p>“Some one coming along the lane in a carriage,”
he said. “I must be off.”</p>

<p>He went out and in a moment I heard him
begin to bark loudly. Then his master spoke
to him and he was still and I heard another
voice that I knew.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said William. “Seen a stray
dachshund around here?”</p>

<p>“What might that be?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“A black dog with tan markings; long body
and short legs,” answered William.</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t seen any dog except this one
here. Want to buy him?”</p>

<p>What William said to that I don’t know,
because I began to bark as loudly as I could.
But as soon as I barked Jim barked too and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
barked a lot louder than I could, and I suppose
William couldn’t hear me at all. At any
rate, when I stopped a moment to listen all I
could hear was the sound of the buggy rattling
off down the road. I felt very sorry for myself
then and I laid down in a corner of the
box and whined and whimpered as though my
heart was broken. After a while Jim came
back.</p>

<p>I think he pitied me a little. “I’m sorry I
had to do it,” he said. “If I hadn’t he’d have
beaten me, you know.”</p>

<p>“You could have run away for awhile,” I
whimpered.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried that. It doesn’t do. He doesn’t
forget. When I come back I get the beating
just the same. Cheer up, Fritz. Maybe
you’ll have luck and find a nicer home than the
one you had.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be nicer,” I said, “and even if
it was I wouldn’t like it. I want to go home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“Where is this home of yours?” he asked.</p>

<p>So I told him, and told him all about William
and the Master and the Mistress and the
Baby and my parents and Freya and everything.
It made me cry some more, but I liked
to talk about the folks I had lost and Jim listened
very politely and seemed interested.</p>

<p>“That must be fine,” he sighed. “You say
they fed you twice a day, regular?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Think of that!” he said. “You aren’t making
it up, are you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know,” he said. “I’ve heard of
such things, but I never really believed them.
Say, if I could help you get away I would,
honest, Fritz! But it’s no use. There isn’t
anything I can do.”</p>

<p>We talked over two or three plans, but there
didn’t seem to be any way out of it. When
it was getting dark again the man came in and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
took me out of the box and led me into the
house. As soon as he let go of the string I
made for the door, but he caught me and
cuffed me and closed the door tightly. Then
he took a box and put me into it and nailed a
lid down on top of me. There were some little
holes bored in the sides of the box which barely
let in enough air for me to breathe. Pretty
soon he took the box under his arm and set
out with it. As we went out of the yard Jim
called “Good-bye, Fritz! Good luck!” But
I was too unhappy to reply.</p>

<small>IN THE ANIMAL STORE</small></h3>
</div>


<p>It was a long journey and I was terribly
frightened. After the man had walked a long
way there was a lot of noise and then we were
in a train, only I didn’t know what it was at
the time. The motion made me very uncomfortable
and I felt a little bit sick at my stomach.
But I managed to go to sleep presently,
with my nose close up to one of the holes in
the box.</p>

<p>The next thing I knew the box was being
lifted up and then the man carried me for
awhile. It was very noisy where we went and
it smelled differently from any place I’d ever
been. I guessed it was the City, and I was
right. When we reached the end of the journey
the cover of the box was taken off and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
found myself in a little room with the man who
had stolen me and another man who looked
very dirty and fat. I could hear a lot of funny
noises; dogs barking and cats meowing and
birds chirping. The man who had brought me
there said:</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars takes him, Bill, and not a
cent less. He’s a prize-winner, he is. Belongs
to—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear who he belongs to,”
said the other man. “You bring him to me
and say you want to sell him. That’s enough.
If he wasn’t your dog I wouldn’t be buying
him. But twenty dollars is all I can pay for
him. There ain’t much call for dachshunds
just now. They ain’t in style.”</p>

<p>So the two men talked and talked for a long
time, the man who had brought me saying he
must have thirty dollars and the other man
saying he could only pay twenty. But after
awhile they agreed on a price and the new man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
gave the other some money and he went away.
Then the new man took me into another room
that was filled with cages and put me into one
and gave me water and food. I was very
thirsty and a little bit hungry, but the place
was so strange that I didn’t do more than
drink a little water at first.</p>

<p>There were lots of dogs there in cages, some
of them just little puppies, and there were cats,
too, cats with long hair and bushy tails and
cats with short hair, and one cat with no tail
at all! And there was a goat, too, and parrots
and canaries and queer birds whose names I
didn’t know, and lizards and turtles and goldfish
swimming about in tanks of water. <a href="#i_166fp">Oh,
it was a funny, queer place</a>, and as for noise—well,
I’d never heard anything like it! Even
the dog show was a quiet place compared to
that store. People came in from the street
outside and stared at us through the bars of
the cages and poked their fingers at us and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
laughed when we were frightened, as I was,
or when we tried to lick their hands, as the puppies
did.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_166fp">
  <img src="images/i_166fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_164">Oh, it was a funny, queer place</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Right across the aisle from where I was
there was a little cage made mostly of glass
and in it were some tiny white mice with funny
pink noses. Every little while one of the mice
would come out of a loaf of bread where they
lived and get in the middle of the cage and go
around and around and around in a circle as
fast as he could spin! I suppose he was chasing
his tail, just as I used to do when I was a
puppy, but he did it so fast that my eyes ached.
Sometimes two of the mice would spin at the
same time and it made me dizzy to see them.</p>

<p>Well, I stayed in that store for many days,
just how many I don’t remember. Several
times folks asked about me; what my name
was, how old I was, had I any tricks, what my
price was; and once I was nearly bought by a
very stout lady who had lots of rings on her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
fingers. But I didn’t like her smell—you
know we dogs judge folks a good deal by their
smell—and so I snapped at her when she went
to stroke me and she said right away that she
wouldn’t take me. I thought that the man
would be very angry with me, but he wasn’t.
He just chuckled as he put me back in the
cage.</p>

<p>After that I made up my mind that I would
have to stay right there in that store all the
rest of my days, for I had heard the man tell
folks that my price was fifty dollars, and fifty
dollars seemed a great deal of money and I
didn’t believe that any one would ever give that
much for me. The man used to tell folks a
great many fibs about me. He said my name
was Kaiser and that I was raised in Germany
and had taken twenty-four prizes at dog shows
since I had been in this country. He said I
was just two years old and as sound as a
whistle. He wasn’t far wrong as to my age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and I was sound, but the rest of the things he
said were just plain fibs. I was sorry about
the fibs, for he was rather a nice man and
treated us all quite kindly, and I was afraid
something dreadful would happen to him for
telling stories. It is very wrong to tell fibs,
of course, and dogs never do it.</p>

<p>I made several friendships at that store.
There was Mouser, who lived next cage to me.
I never thought that I should like a cat, but I
did. He was a big grey cat and had the longest
whiskers I ever saw. He and I would put
our heads through the bars and have fine long
talks together. He had seen a great deal of
life and had always lived in the City. At first
he wouldn’t believe the things I told him about
the country. He took quite an interest in
Ju-Ju and said he thought she was a very lucky
cat. Mouser didn’t know who his parents
were or where he was born. Isn’t that
strange? Fancy not knowing your own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
father or mother! I wouldn’t like that, would
you?</p>

<p>Mouser said that when he was a tiny little
kitten he lived just anywhere; under doorsteps
and on roofs and in sheds; and all he had to
eat was what he could find in the gutters. I
guess he had a pretty hard time of it until a
little girl picked him up one day and took him
home with her. After that he had a nice home
for nearly a year. Then the little girl’s family
went away and closed the house up and Mouser
was put out into the street again to get along
as best he could. It was harder then than it
was before, because he had got used to having
his food given to him and to having a nice warm
place to sleep each night. For awhile he almost
starved, he said, and had to fight other
cats, and dogs, too, and even rats sometimes,
to get anything to eat. He said he stayed
around the house he had been living in for a
long time, hoping the family would come back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
again and let him in, but they never did and so
finally he wandered away to another part of
the town where there were many more garbage
barrels. He said he was like the cat in the
verse that the little girl used to recite to him.
I asked him what the verse was and he repeated
it to me. This was it:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor little Kitty-in-the-Street!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ain’t got no thing to eat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ain’t got no garbage pails,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ain’t got no fishes’ tails;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor little Kitty-in-the-Street</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ain’t got no thing to eat!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I think it is quite a sad little verse, don’t
you?</p>

<p>One day when Mouser was prowling about
looking for his dinner a man with a net on the
end of a pole came along and slipped the net
over him and took him off in a wagon to a
place where there were lots and lots of cats
who had no homes, like Mouser. The next
day a lady came looking for a cat who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
catch mice and a man whose place it was to
find homes for the cats said:</p>

<p>“Got just what you want, Lady. Here’s
a fine big fellow that’s a regular mouser.”</p>

<p>So the lady liked his looks and carried him
to her home in a basket and named him Mouser.
Before that he had had another name, but he
didn’t remember what it was. He stayed with
the lady for a long time and then she, too, went
away to live in a place where cats were not allowed
and so she brought Mouser to the animal
dealer’s, and here he was looking for a new
home. I told him I didn’t think I would like
having so many homes, but he said you got used
to it in time and that almost anything was better
than no home at all and being just a
“Kitty-in-the-Street!”</p>

<p>Then there was Prince. Prince was a
funny, good-natured dog who lived in a big
cage across the aisle. He wasn’t any regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
kind of dog, but a little of every kind. He had
a long brown coat and a shaggy tail and a
pointed nose and very yellow eyes. One of his
ears stood up straight and the other fell over
just as if it was tired. But he was a real nice,
jolly fellow, and had the finest, deepest bark I
ever heard. He was just about my age and
had been born in the country. One day he
came with his master to the city to sell a load
of vegetables at the market and another dog
quarrelled with him and they had an awful
fight and the other dog bit him so that he had
to run away. And when he stopped running
he was quite lost! He hunted around and at
last he found the market again, but his master
had gone. So he stayed there for a long time
and the marketman gave him pieces of meat
and he got along very nicely. He thought
that some day his master would come back
again. And perhaps he did, but Prince wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
there because one day a boy tied a piece of rope
about his neck and took him to the animal
dealer’s and sold him for fifty cents.</p>

<p>He was quite happy and contented, though,
and I liked him very much. And I hope that
he and Mouser each found a nice home. There
was a little white and tan dog whose name was
Peaches—which is a funny name for a dog,
isn’t it?—and he lived in a cage next to Prince
for awhile. He was sold while I was there
and taken away by a big man with a gruff voice
to hunt rats in a stable. Peaches was not a
very gentlemanly dog, but he was full of fun
and we all liked him a lot. One of the funny
things he did was to stand on his front legs,
with his hind legs in the air, and walk around
the cage. And while he did it he would say:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mary had a little dog,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">He was a noble pup;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">He’d stand upon his front legs</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">When you held his hind legs up!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>The parrots were noisy things. I don’t see
why any one should want a parrot around, do
you? There was one that used to look at me
by the hour with his head on one side until I
got quite nervous. When I barked at him he
would laugh and say “Here, Fido! Here,
Fido! Good dog! Good dog! Who killed
the chicken?” I wished very much that I
could have got hold of that parrot and pulled
some of his tail-feathers out!</p>

<p>Well, I stayed in that store a long time, and
I got so I didn’t mind the noise much. We
had plenty to eat and drink and once a day we
were taken into a tiny yard at the back to run
around. Of course I wasn’t happy, and I
used to long for my home and Mother and
Father and the Baby and William and Freya
and, most of all, I think, for Alfred. When
I got to thinking about them I felt very sad
and would often cry myself to sleep, just as I
used to do behind the flower-pots. I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
I missed those flower-pots a great deal those
days! I had quite given up the hope of ever
getting back to my home, or even getting away
from the animal store, when one day a wonderful
thing happened, a thing so wonderful
that it deserves a chapter all to itself!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_2X">CHAPTER X<br />
<small>BACK HOME AGAIN</small></h3>
</div>


<p>I was having a little nap at the back of my cage
when I heard a lady’s voice say: “No, thank
you, we are just looking about. My little boy
wants to see the dogs.”</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears, for I seemed to know
that voice, but I couldn’t think whose it was.
The lady was out of sight and I waited eagerly
for her to reach my cage. And while she was
still at the front of the store I heard another
voice say, “Mother, do you suppose they have
any dachshunds?” and my heart just jumped
right up into my throat. For the voice was
Alfred’s! I leaped against the bars and
barked and barked, I can tell you! And
Alfred and his mother heard me and came to
see what all the noise meant. And when
Alfred saw me he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, here’s a dear little dachshund!
Oh, please may I have him?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, dear,” said his mother.
“He <em>is</em> a nice looking dog, isn’t he? Are you
sure you want him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes!” said Alfred. “Really, I do,
Mother! He looks so much like Fritzie,
doesn’t he? Don’t you think he does?”</p>

<p>Alfred put his hand into the cage to pat my
head and I licked it and tried to reach his face
with my tongue and whined and whined. And
Alfred’s eyes got rounder and rounder, and
suddenly he cried very loudly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, it <em>is</em> Fritzie! It is! It is!
He knows me, Mother!”</p>

<p>And—oh, well, I don’t remember much
about what happened after that for a while!
I know the man came and let me out of the
cage and I jumped and barked and whined
and went on terribly silly, I guess. But you
didn’t mind, did you? And then, almost before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
I knew it, I was snuggled up in—in
Alfred’s arms in a carriage and we were rattling
over the cobblestones at a great rate.
And Alfred was crying and hugging me and
his mother was smiling and crying a little too.
I wasn’t, though; not then; I was far too happy
to cry!</p>

<p>And then—but you know the rest of my
story as well as I do. How the Master came
up to the City and took me home again and
how glad I was to see Mother and Father and
Freya and every one else. And how William
blew his nose over and over again and seemed
to have a very bad cold in his head, and how
the Baby said “Booful dogums!” and hugged
me until I had almost no breath left! But
there was one thing I don’t think you ever
knew about fully, and that was how the brindle
bulldog came to be there.</p>

<p>I had been home nearly an hour and was
lying in the doorway talking to Mother and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Father and Freya, telling them all about what
had happened to me while I was away, when
a brindled bulldog came trotting up the road.
He was a very ugly looking dog and when I
saw him I growled. But the others paid no
attention to him. As he came nearer he reminded
me of some dog I had seen somewhere
and so I asked who he was.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mother, “that’s just Jim. He
came here a month ago and wouldn’t let William
drive him away. So he lives here now.
He’s a very nice dog. Rather coarse in his
ways and not much to look at, but good-hearted
and kind and a fine fellow to keep
watch.”</p>

<p>Then I remembered him. He was the dog
who had belonged to the man who had stolen
me. Of course I ran right out and said
“Bow!” to him and we were very glad to see
each other. He told me that after his master
had gone away to take me to the City he got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
to thinking about my home and how fine it
would be to live in such a place and have regular
meals and be spoken to kindly now and
then and he had made up his mind to run away
and go there. You see, he thought that as the
Family had lost me maybe they’d like a dog
to take my place. That was quite clever of
Jim, don’t you think? And so he left his
home before his master came back and trotted
down the lane and into the big road and so up
to the stable.</p>

<p>At first Father tried to drive him away and
there was quite a rumpus, but Jim wouldn’t
go. Then William tried to drive him away
and got after him with the carriage whip.
(Of course William didn’t hurt him any, because
he never would hurt a dog more than was
good for him.) And still Jim wouldn’t go.
So William felt sorry for him then and gave
him some food and Jim slept outside the stable
that night. When William found him there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the next day he tried to drive him away again.
But Jim came right back and so William fixed
him up a box in the yard and ever since Jim
had been one of the family. He told me that
he was very happy and that he had never had
so much to eat in all his life! The Master took
a great fancy to Jim and Jim to the Master
and they were fine friends. Of course the
Family didn’t know that his name was Jim,
because he never told them, and so they called
him Tramp.</p>

<p>It was awfully nice to be back home once
more, I can tell you, and Mother and Father
and Freya were so glad to see me that they
just couldn’t do enough for me. Freya hung
around so close that she got to be rather a
bother! She never got tired of hearing about
the wonderful things that had happened to
me, and about Mouser and Prince and, especially,
about Peaches, the dog who stood on his
front legs. Even Ju-Ju seemed glad to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
me back. I may be wrong about that, though.
Cats are queer animals and you can’t tell much
about what they’re thinking.</p>

<p>But glad as I was to be back home I was a
little sad all the time. I missed Alfred a lot.
And when, a few weeks later, the Family got
ready to go to the City for a visit and I learned
that I was to go with them I was awfully
pleased because I thought that I should see
Alfred again. And I did, didn’t I? Do you
remember when the Baby brought me in here
that morning and said:</p>

<p>“Afed, here is Kismus present for oo, Mild’ed’s
booful dogum!”</p>

<p>You were almost as glad as I was, weren’t
you?</p>

<p>Well, there, that’s all my story. Next
month we’re going back to see them all, aren’t
we? I shall like that. I suppose Freya is
fatter than ever now. She doesn’t hunt
enough. I shall tell Mother so, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>Heigho! I think I’m getting sleepy. I
have talked a great deal for a dog, and this pillow
is very comfy. If you will lean over I’d
like to lick your face. Then I shall take a nap.
But don’t forget to call me when you are ready
to go to walk. There’s a squirrel in the Park—<a href="#i_178fp">he
lives in the fourth tree</a> after you go
through the big gate—and he made a face at
me yesterday ... or was it the day before?
Anyway, ... he ought ... to be taught
... manners....</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
